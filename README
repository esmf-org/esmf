                                   README

                    Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)

================================================================================

README file for ESMF v2.0.0 release.

The files contained here include the ESMF source code and build system.

More information about the ESMF project can be found at the ESMF web site:
        
        http://www.esmf.ucar.edu

For additional documentation on building and running the ESMF please
see the ESMF User's Guide on the ESMF web site, under the "Downloads &
Documentation" link.

The ESMF library source code is also available for download at:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/esmf

Follow the directions on that webpage to access the ESMF CVS repository.

================================================================================

QuickStart information for the impatient.

 - set environment variable (see below).
 - Type 'gmake' (the GNU make program) to build the ESMF library.
 - Type 'gmake tests' to make and run the unit tests
    (or 'gmake tests_uni' for non-mpi machines).
 - Type 'gmake system_tests' to make and run the system tests
    (or 'gmake system_tests_uni' for non-mpi machines).
 - Type 'gmake examples' to make and run the examples applications
    (or 'gmake examples_uni' for non-mpi machines).
 - Type 'gmake ESMF_COUPLED_FLOW' to compile and run a coupled fluid flow 
   demo program.  It will run in parallel, 4-way, compute 3600 time steps, and
   produce 10 data dumps.

Directories
-----------

build_config:    Contains makefile fragments that can 
                 be customized by the user for specific platforms,
                 compilers, and sites.

build:           Contains the generic portion of the build, that a
                 user would not be expected to modify.

scripts:         Contains scripts for testing and uniprocessor runs, and some
                 templates.

src:             Contains the source code.

In addition, the following directories are created during the building
and testing stages:

doc:             Contains documentation (if built).

lib:             Contains the ESMF libraries.

mod:             Contains the Fortran module files.

test:            Contains unit and system test executables and output.

examples:	 Contains examples executables and output.


System Information
------------------

The following platforms are fully supported: Alpha, IRIX64 32-bit and 64-bit
addressing, IBM 32-bit and 64-bit addressing, Linux intel 32-bit and 64-bit
addressing. ESMF is built and debugged in other platforms on a regular basis.
Check the build_config directory for more information.


Environment Variables
---------------------

Currently the ESMF_DIR environment variable must be set on all
platforms.  ESMF_DIR should be set to the path of the top
level ESMF directory. The ESMF_COMPILER environment variable
must be set only on Linux platforms. The possible values are:
absoft, intel, lahey, pgi or nag. 

There are several other environment variables which can be set to 
customize the ESMF make process. The README file in the directory 
build_config documents the entire list of environment variables in detail, 
as does the ESMF User's Guide.


Build Information
-----------------

GNU make is required to build the library.  On most systems this will
be just the command gmake.  On others it might be installed as gnumake
or even just make.  In any event, use the --version option with these
make commands to determine which is GNU make.

Build the library with the command:
 
  gmake 

for an optimized version or

  gmake ESMF_BOPT=g

for a debug version.

To build and run the coupled fluid flow demo:

  gmake  ESMF_COUPLED_FLOW

To build and run the system tests:

  gmake  system_tests
  gmake  system_tests_uni   ! for non-mpi machines

To build and run the unit tests:

  gmake  tests
  gmake  tests_uni          ! for non-mpi machines

To build and run the unit tests in exhaustive mode:

  gmake  ESMF_EXHAUSTIVE=ON tests
  gmake  ESMF_EXHAUSTIVE=ON tests_uni    ! for non-mpi machines

The exhaustive unit tests option is a *compile* time option.  Use

  gmake clean 

first if the unit tests have already been compiled without the
ESMF_EXHAUSTIVE=ON option.

Output files from the tests are directed to files in
${ESMF_DIR}/test/test${ESMF_BOPT}/${ESMF_ARCH}.$(ESMF_COMPILER).$(ESMF_PREC).$(ESMF_SITE)
directories.

To build documentation:

  gmake pdf           ! Makes the pdf files
  gmake html          ! Creates the html directory.
  gmake alldoc        ! Builds all the above documents.

Final documentation files will be located in the ${ESMF_DIR}/doc
directory.  


Usage
-----

To use ESMF from Fortran, add the directory that contains
the ESMF *.mod file(s),

${ESMF_DIR}/mod/mod${ESMF_BOPT}/${ESMF_ARCH}.$(ESMF_COMPILER).$(ESMF_PREC).$(ESMF_SITE)

to your search path for *.mod files.  For most compilers this path is
identified either with a -I or a -M.  You must also link with the ESMF
shared object library.  This is a file called libesmf.so that is
located in the following directory:

${ESMF_DIR}/lib/lib${ESMF_BOPT}/${ESMF_ARCH}.$(ESMF_COMPILER).$(ESMF_PREC).$(ESMF_SITE)

There is a single ESMF module, called ESMF_Mod, that should be
included in applications with the Fortran USE statement.  It is not
necessary to include any header files in Fortran.

To use ESMF from C/C++, link with the ESMF shared object library and
include the ESMC.h file.

If you prefer standard libraries, a *.a file is provided in the same
library directory as the shared object file.

For information on how to link with shared libraries on a particular
platform, please see the link_rules files in the platform directories
in build_config.
