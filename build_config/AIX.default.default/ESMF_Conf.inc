Define the proper way to flush Fortran units.  Typically this will
be one of the following:

  * Fortran-2003 FLUSH statement (preferred)
  * Two argument FLUSH call
  * One argument FLUSH call

#endif

#define ESMF_IOFlushMacro(unit,status) call flush_ (unit)

Apparently some versions the AIX xlf 8.x compiler are unable to 
handle initializers for derived type contents.  If this is a problem
on your system, remove the #if 0/#endif lines and fix the #define line
before you compile the framework.
