================================================================================

The files in this directory contain per-platform makefile information which is 
included by the ESMF build system.


Naming Conventions
------------------

The subdirectories here follow a 3-part naming convention:

The first part is the system name, which is set automatically using the 
output from 'uname -s'.  (The Cray X1 is an exception; the environment 
variable ESMF_ARCH should be set to 'Unicos' before building there.)

The second part is the compiler name for those platforms which support
compilers from different vendors.  For those systems which come with a
single vendor-supplied compiler, the compiler name is 'default'.  
The environment variable ESMF_COMPILER is used to select the compiler.

The last part of the name is the site-specific information.  The 'default'
directories contain files which are always read for the given 
architecture/compiler combination.  Then, in addition, if the environment
variable ESMF_SITE has a value, the corresponding directory will be 
searched after the default directory, for overrides and additional settings 
of directory names, values, flags, and other custom information.


File Descriptions
-----------------

Each default directory contains the following files:

 ESMC_Conf.h    : C++ preprocessor definitions needed for this platform.

 ESMF_Conf.inc  : values needed by both preprocessed F90 and C++; contains
                  information in a format parseable by both languages.         

 build_rules.mk : makefile fragment which is included by the main ESMF build
                  system and contains specific settings for this platform.

 link_rules     : makefile fragment which suggests how user code would link
                  with the ESMF libraries
        

Additional Environment Variables
--------------------------------

See the ESMF User's Guide for a complete description of all the environment
variables supported by the build system.  However, for convienence, these
are the ones most likely to be necessary to adjust for new platforms:

On platforms that don't support Pthreads the following option is critical:

ESMF_PTHREADS     

The default value is ON. Setting this variable to OFF will turn ESMF's
pthreads features off and a stub header file will be used instead of the
Pthreads header during library compilation. This may be necessary on systems
that do not supply a working Pthreads implementation.


Compiling with or without netCDF I/O libraries:

NETCDF_LIB
NETCDF_INCLUDE    

By default the system does not try to link in the netCDF I/O libraries, but
the makefiles are prepared to include them if these variables are defined.
To use netCDF I/O, set both NETCDF_LIB and NETCDF_INCLUDE environment 
variables to the directories where the netCDF files have been installed.


Selecting a particular C compiler or Compiler Version:

ESMF_C_COMPILER         
ESMF_COMPILER_VERSION

If it is possible to compile Fortran code with different C compilers on this
platform (e.g. vendor-supplied C vs. gcc) then ESMF_C_COMPILER should control
this choice.   If there are incompatible changes in flags or link libs from
one version of the compiler to another, ESMF_COMPILER_VERSION should be set to
the numeric version to select the right case inside the makefiles.



Customizing an Existing Platform
--------------------------------

0. Check on http://sourceforge.net/projects/esmfcontrib -> CVS to be sure
   someone else has not already done this for your location or machine.

1. Set the environment variable ESMF_SITE to a string.  Suggested values are
   either your location (e.g. mit, cola) or a specific machine (e.g. bluesky).

2. Make a subdirectory named in the form:  system.compiler.site

3. Initially copy over only build_rules.mk from the corresponding default
   directory and remove all values which remain the same.  The build_rules.mk
   file in this site-specific directory will be included after the default
   one has been read, so only differences should be maintained.  

4. The ESMC_Conf.h and ESMF_conf.inc files do not need to be copied.

5. Test and get it working.

6. Post it back on the esmfcontrib sourceforge site for others to use.


Adding a New Platform
---------------------

1. Create a new subdirectory which follows the naming conventions.

2. Copy the contents of the most similar existing directory over to the 
   new directory.

3. Edit the build_rules.mk file to set the compiler names, flags, etc.
   Since ESMF contains both F90 and C++ code, generally the linkers are
   not able to simply link without being given additional libraries.

   Generally the C_CXXF90LIBS line (F90 libraries which need to be added to
   the link line when the link is being done with the C++ compiler), and the
   C_F90CXXLIBS line (C++ libs which need to be added when the link is being
   done with the F90 compiler) will need to be updated.  Running a C++ or F90
   link in a single language with -v (or whatever flag gives verbose output
   about the exact lines being executed) may help find what libraries are
   silently added by the compilers.

   The build_rules.mk file should only need to set C_xxx variables, which
   is the naming convention for platform specific values.  If you have to
   set a value which does not have a C_xxx name in order to compile, email
   esmf_support@ucar.edu to let us know.

4. Edit the ESMC_Conf.h file and look over the values.  (In reality, most
   of these variables are not actually used.)  However, see the ESMF_F90_PTR
   settings at the end of the file.  These *must* match the size of the 
   "dope vector" that the Fortran compiler uses on this machine to store
   information about Fortran arrays (rank, lower bounds, upper bounds, etc).  
   Put in a good guess (or leave them as-is) and build and run the unit tests.

   Ignore the output of all other unit tests until the ESMF_ArrayF90PtrUTest
   passes cleanly without complaining about byte count mismatches.  Adjust the
   sizes in the ESMC_Conf.h file until it passes, and then make clean and
   rebuild the entire library and test suite.

5. Once it is working, post it back on the esmfcontrib sourceforge site and
   email esmf_support@ucar.edu so we can include it in our next release.


Platform Specific Notes Related to makefiles and Environment Variables
----------------------------------------------------------------------

AIX systems - Those using LoadLeveler will generally need to set the
MP_RMPOOL environment variable, and generally 1 will be a good value.
See your own system admins for more help on this if 1 doesn't work.

OSF (HP/Compaq) systems - Our makefiles support those systems needing 
a -P project number argument to the bsub command in order to correctly 
charge system usage.  Set the ESMF_PROJECT environment variable to the
project name and it will be passed with -P into bsub when submitting a job.
See your own system admins for more info on whether this is needed.

Linux/intel - The intel compilers have an additional option on cross-language
linking.  You can compile with the intel C and Fortran compilers, but then
link with the gcc libraries.  To use this combination set ESMF_C_LIBRARY to gcc.

Darwin (Mac)/xlf - This compiler supports compiling and linking with either
gcc or xlc.  Use ESMF_C_COMPILER to control this choice.
