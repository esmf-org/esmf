The files in this directory are customizable makefile fragments
for the ESMF build system.  


ESMF Build System Overview
--------------------------

The ESMF build system consists of:
1. A set of makefiles included in the source code at each directory level.
2. A set of makefile fragment files designed to be used by the source 
   code makefiles.  Makefile fragment files are files that contain 
   makefile syntax defining build rules and actions, but do not 
   constitute a complete build system.

There are two kinds of makefile fragment files that are used by the build.  
The first is the file common.mk, located in the build directory.  This file 
defines build rules and variables that are used across all platforms.  Users 
should have no need to edit it.

The second type of makefile fragment is customizable.  There are a set of
these fragments located in the build_config directory.  The customizable
fragments specify makefile settings for a particular architecture and in 
some cases specific compilers and machines.  The common.mk file includes 
one of these customizable fragments based on environment variable settings.
  
Customizable makefile fragment directories follow this naming convention:

     build_config/ESMF_ARCH.ESMF_COMPILER.ESMF_SITE

ESMF_ARCH, ESMF_COMPILER and ESMF_SITE are three environment variables
that are either set by the user or are given default values in
common.mk.  These variables are described in detail in the Environment 
Variables section that immediately follows this one.

The ESMF_ARCH value used for the first part of the filename specifies the
architecture that the file should be used for.

The middle part of a makefile fragment name, ESMF_COMPILER, represents 
the desired compiler.  

The ESMF_SITE value used for the last part of the filename will
either have the value default or a machine's name.  If default is used
then the file in most cases can be used with any machine of the
architecture given by ESMF_ARCH.  If a machine's name is used, then
that particular machine uses makefile settings other then the default
settings for its architecture.

Current build files for supported platforms:

      build_config/AIX.default.default
                   Darwin.xlf.default
                   IRIX64.default.default
                   Linux.absoft.default
                   Linux.intel.default
                   Linux.lahey.default
                   Linux.nag.default
                   Linux.pgi.default
                   OSF1.default.default


Current build files for unsupported platforms:

      build_config/Darwin.absoft.default
                   Darwin.nag.default
                   SunOS.default.default
                   Unicos.default.default

Notice that there is no default compiler value for Linux or Darwin
(Mac) machines.  This is because there are a number of Fortran90 Linux
compilers.  If ESMF_COMPILER is left unset then the default value
for Linux machines will be lahey and for Darwin machines absoft.

Customizing the ESMF Build
--------------------------

The build system can be ported to other Unix platforms by adding new
makefile fragments and configuration include files.  The new fragment 
has to follow the naming convention used by the existing fragments and 
be created in build_config.  The new fragment also has to define the same
makefile variables as the existing files.

The ESMC_Conf.h and ESMF_Conf.inc include files are used to define machine 
attributes within C/C++ and Fortran source code.  Like fragment files, 
new files have to define the same machine attributes as existing files.  
If a machine supports both 32 and 64 bit precision, then the files must have
a conditional section for any values which are dependent on the precision.


Environment Variables
---------------------

 ESMF_ARCH         Variable describing the current
                   machine architecture.  Default value
                   is value returned by uname -s.

 ESMF_COMPILER     Variable specifying which compiler to use.  Value
                   can be default, absoft, intel, lahey, pgi or nag. 
                   If the value is default or ESMF_COMPILER is 
                   left unset, then the default compiler 
                   will be used.  Exceptions for default values:
                   On Linux machines the default value is lahey and
                   on Darwin machines it is absoft.

 ESMF_PREC         Variable specifying the precision.  Value 
                   can be 32 or 64.  When possible the default 
                   value will be 64, otherwise it will be 32.

 ESMF_SITE         If ESMF_SITE is not set or has the value of
                   default, default build settings for the current machine
                   architecture and compiler will be used. Otherwise the 
                   setting will be used to select site-specific build files 
                   which have been configured for a particular location.   
                   See the CVS repository: 
                       http://sourceforge.net/projects/esmfcontrib/
                   for existing site files or to contribute new ones.

 ESMF_COMM         Defines which MPI communications library to use.  
                   Many times a machine will come with its own MPI 
                   library and in those cases the default setting 
                   will be mpi.  Otherwise the default setting will be 
                   mpiuni so that the mpiuni library will be used.
                   Other possible settings are mpich and lam.

 ESMF_BOPT         Variable specifying that the build system
                   use either debugging  or optimization options.
                   Value of g specifies the debugging options.
                   Value of O (capital oh) specifies optimization
                   options.  Default value is O.
 
 ESMF_DIR or       See note below.
 ESMF_EVA_DIR or
 ESMF_IMPL_DIR

ESMF distributes multiple codes (e.g., ESMF source, Implementation Report
examples, ESMF Validation Suite) and this build is used to compile all
of them.

The top level directory path of the ESMF code being built must be specified
using an environment variable. The appropriate variable(s) to set are 
described in the top-level README file of the ESMF code you are trying to 
build.  For example, for the ESMF source this variable is ESMF_DIR.

Platform notes:
________________

Compaq alpha - Before running on the Compaq, you will need to set the
environment variable ESMF_PROJECT to a valid project number suitable
for the -P option on bsub. If you do not know what to set this to
first run with it unset and you should be prompted by the system for
valid values for your userid.

IBM rs6000 - Before running on rs6000 machines, you will need to set
an additional environment variable MP_RMPOOL to a valid node
allocation pool.  Usually this will be a value of 1.

Usage
-----

To link your application to the ESMF shared libraries refer to the 
link_rules file in the makefile fragment directories. The link_rules are 
provided only for the supported platforms.
