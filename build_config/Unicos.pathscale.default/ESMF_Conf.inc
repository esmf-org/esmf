Define the proper way to flush Fortran units.  Typically this will
be one of the following:

  * Fortran-2003 FLUSH statement (preferred)
  * Two argument FLUSH call
  * One argument FLUSH call

#endif

#define ESMF_IOFlushMacro(unit,status) call flush (unit, status)

#if 0
Define the proper way to read the command line.  Absoft does not
have the Fortran-2003 command line intrinsics.  So use Posix calls.

in theory absoft supports initializers, but in practice with the number
of modules we include, it seems to cause problems when enabled.
