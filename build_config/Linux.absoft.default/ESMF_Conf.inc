Define the proper way to flush Fortran units.  Typically this will
be one of the following:

  * Fortran-2003 FLUSH statement (preferred)
  * Two argument FLUSH call
  * One argument FLUSH call

#endif

#define ESMF_IOFlushMacro(unit,status) call flush (unit)

#if 0

have the Fortran-2003 command line intrinsics, nor Posix calls.
So use getarg.
