GNU Make is required to build the ESMF library.  On some
systems this will be just the command \texttt{make}.  On others
it might be installed as \texttt{gmake} or \texttt{gnumake}.
This document uses {\tt make} consistently to refer to GNU Make.

Use the {\tt \verb+--+version} option with the locally available make commands
to determine which variant corresponds to GNU Make on your system. Use the
respective command when interacting with the ESMF build system, and
where this documentation uses {\tt make}.

Notice that ESMF does not utilize Autotools (configure or autoconf) or CMake.
Instead, the selection of configuration options is done by setting environment
variables before building the framework. The relevant environment variables
all begin with prefix {\tt ESMF\_}, and are discussed in detail under section
\ref{EnvironmentVariables}.
