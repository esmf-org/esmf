This directory contains a single file `common.mk` that contains
GNU makefile code used by the ESMF build system across all platforms.
Users should generally have no reason to edit this file!

The only directory that should be here is a doc directory. This 
directory contains tex files used for build system documentation.

See README.md files at the top level of this distribution and in 
build_config for documentation on the build system. The ESMF User's 
Guide also contains build system documentation.
