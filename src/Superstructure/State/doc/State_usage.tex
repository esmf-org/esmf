%\subsection{Use and Examples}

A Gridded Component generally has one associated import 
State and one export State.  Generally the States 
associated with a Gridded Component will be created by 
the Gridded Component's parent component.
In many cases, the States will be created containing 
no data.  Both the empty States and the
newly created Gridded Component are passed
by the parent component into the Gridded Component's initialize 
method.  This is where the States get prepared for use 
and the import State is first filled with data.

States can be filled with data items that do not yet 
have data allocated.  Fields, FieldBundles, Arrays, and ArrayBundles each have 
methods that support their creation without actual data 
allocation - the Grid and Attributes are set up but no
Fortran array of data values is allocated.  In this approach, 
when a State is passed into its associated Gridded Component's 
initialize method, the incomplete Arrays, Fields, FieldBundles,
and ArrayBundles within the State can allocate or reference data 
inside the initialize method.

States are passed through the interfaces of the Gridded 
and Coupler Components' run methods in order to carry data 
between the components.  While we expect
a Gridded Component's import State to be filled with data 
during initialization, its export State will typically be
filled over the course of its run method.  At the end of
a Gridded Component's run method, the filled export State 
is passed out through the argument list into a Coupler 
Component's run method.  We recommend the convention that 
it enters the Coupler Component as the Coupler Component's
import State.  Here is it transformed into a form
that another Gridded Component requires, and passed out
of the Coupler Component as its export State.  It can then
be passed into the run method of a recipient Gridded Component
as that component's import State.

While the above sounds complicated, the rule is simple:
a State going into a component is an import State, and a 
State leaving a component is an export State.

Objects inside States are normally created in {\tt unison} where
each PET executing a component makes the same object create call.
If the object contains data, like a Field, each PET may have a
different local chunk of the entire dataset but each Field has
the same name and is logically one part of a single distributed 
object.   As States are passed between components, if any object
in a State was not created in unison on all the current PETs 
then some PETs have no object to pass into a
communication method (e.g. regrid or data redistribution).
The {\tt ESMF\_StateReconcile()} method must be called to broadcast 
information about these objects to all PETs in a component;
after which all PETs have a single uniform view of all objects and metadata.  

If components are running in sequential mode on all available PETs
and States are being passed between them there is no need to call 
{\tt ESMF\_StateReconcile} since all PETs have a uniform view of the objects.
However, if components are running on a subset of the PETs, as is
usually the case when running in concurrent mode, then when States
are passed into components which contain a superset of those PETs,
for example, a Coupler Component, all PETs must call {\tt ESMF\_StateReconcile}
on the States before using them in any ESMF communication methods.
The reconciliation process broadcasts information about objects
which exist only on a subset of the PETs.  On PETs missing those
objects it creates a {\it proxy} object which contains any
qualities of the original object plus enough information for it
to be a data source or destination for a regrid or data redistribution
operation.  There is an option to turn off metadata reconciliation in the 
{\tt ESMF\_StateReconcile} call.

\subsubsection{State create and destroy}

States can be created and destroyed at any time during
application execution.  The {\tt ESMF\_StateCreate()} routine
can take many different combinations of optional arguments.  Refer
to the API description for all possible methods of creating a State.
An empty State can be created by providing only a name and type for
the intended State:

{\tt state = ESMF\_StateCreate(name, stateintent=ESMF\_STATEINTENT\_IMPORT, rc=rc)}

When finished with an {\tt ESMF\_State}, the {\tt ESMF\_StateDestroy} method
removes it.  However, the objects inside the {\tt ESMF\_State}
created externally should be destroyed separately,
since objects can be added to more than one {\tt ESMF\_State}.
