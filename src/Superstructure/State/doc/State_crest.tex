%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\bf No synchronization of object IDs at object create time.}
Object IDs are used during the reconcile process to identify objects
which are unknown to some subset of the PETs in the currently running VM.
Object IDs are assigned in sequential order at object create time.

One important request by the user community during the ESMF object design was
that there be no communication overhead or synchronization when creating
distributed ESMF objects. As a consequence it is required to create these
objects in {\bf unison} across all PETs in order to keep the ESMF object
identification in sync.

\end{enumerate}
