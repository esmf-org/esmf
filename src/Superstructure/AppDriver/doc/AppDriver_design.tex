%\subsection{Design}

The Application Driver directory contains subdirectories with sample
source files, each of which shows an example of using ESMF in a
different way.  The user decides on which strategy they want to follow
and then copies the files from the corresponding subdirectory into
their own directory. Some of the files can be used unchanged, others
are {\tt template} files which have the rough outline of the code but
need significant amounts of application-specific code added in order 
to perform the desired computation.
