%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf No Transforms.}  Components must exchange data through   
{\tt ESMF\_State} objects.  The input data are available at the time 
the user Component code is called, and data to be returned to another 
Component are available when that code returns.  

\item {\bf Data isolation.} 
Gridded Components must only communicate with other
components via data in State objects.  They must 
not make direct references to data in other States.

\item {\bf Namespace isolation.}
If possible, Gridded Components should attempt to make 
all data private, so public names do not interfere with data 
in other components.

\item {\bf Single execution mode.}
It is not expected that a single Gridded Component be able 
to function in both sequential and concurrent modes, although 
Gridded Components of different types can be nested. For example,
a concurrently called Gridded Component can contain several nested 
sequential Gridded Components. 

\end{enumerate}
