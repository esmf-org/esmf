%\subsection{Use and Examples}

A Gridded Component is a computational entity which consumes and produces data. It uses a State object to exchange data between itself and other Components. It uses a Clock object to manage time, and a VM to describe its own and its child components' computational resources.

This section shows how to create Gridded Components.  For demonstrations
of the use of Gridded Components, see the system tests that are bundled with the ESMF software
distribution.  These can be found in the directory {\tt esmf/src/system\_tests}.
