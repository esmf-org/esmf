# ESMX

ESMX is the **E**arth **S**ystem **M**odel e**X**ecutable layer.

http://earthsystemmodeling.org/esmx/

The ESMX layer is built on top of the ESMF and NUOPC APIs.

The idea behind ESMX is to make it as simple as possible for a user to build, run, and test NUOPC based systems. The approach implemented is the same whether applied to a single component, or a fully coupled system of NUOPC-compliant components. ESMX user interfaces are implemented through [YAML](https://yaml.org/) based configuration files.

Major objectives of ESMX are:

 - **Simplification** of standing up new NUOPC-based systems.
 - **Promotion** of hierarchical model component testing.
 - **Reduction** of maintenance cost for established NUOPC-based systems.
 - **Improved** alignment and interoperability between different NUOPC-based systems. (Configuration files, build procedures, etc.)
 - **Faster and more coordinated** roll-out and adoption of new NUOPC/ESMF features.

ESMX unifies, provides, and maintains those parts of NUOPC-based modeling systems that are common across most such implementations. This includes the top level application and driver code, parts of the build infrastructure, and tools to manage run configurations.

## The Unified Driver Executable

One of the main pieces provided by ESMX is the *unified driver executable*. A good starting point to explore this feature is the [ESMX_StartHereProto](https://github.com/esmf-org/nuopc-app-prototypes/tree/develop/ESMX_StartHereProto) example under the NUOPC prototype repository.

The name of the unified driver executable created by ESMX is defined by `exe_name` under `Application Options` (default: esmx_app). `ESMX_EXE_NAME` will be used for the remainder of this section to refer to the unfied driver executable.

### Building ESMX

The ESMX build system is implemented using [CMake](https://cmake.org/). The user has several options for how to interact with the ESMX build system:

- Directly use CMake on the ESMX build files.
- Embed ESMX in a user maintained CMake build system.
- Leverage the `ESMX_Builder` command line tool.

All three options are discussed in detail in the following sections.

#### Direct use of CMake on the ESMX build files

The `ESMX_EXE_NAME` executable for a project that leverages ESMX can be build directly from the project source location. In this approach the CMake command line tool `cmake` is used for the typical configure/build/install steps:

1. Configure:

Assuming the ESMX build configuration file `esmxBuild.yaml` (discussed later in the text) is located in the current working directory.
```
cmake [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<your-install-location>] -S $ESMF_ESMXDIR -B build
```
Here the shell variable `ESMF_ESMXDIR` is assumed to be set according to your ESMF installation. The correct value can be looked up in the file `esmf.mk` associated with the ESMF installation.

2. Build:
```
cmake --build ./build [--parallel] [--verbose]
```

3. Install:
```
cmake --install ./build [--verbose]
```

Use the `ESMX_BUILD_FILE` variable to specify an alternative ESMX build configuration file during the configuration step:
  
```
cmake -DESMX_BUILD_FILE=<your-esmx-build-config-yaml> -B build
```


#### Embedded ESMX in a user maintained CMake build system

This approach requires a user maintained `CMakeFiles.txt` file. The ESMX build system is added via the CMake `add_subdirectory()` function:

```
...
# Add ESMX
add_subdirectory(${ESMF_ESMXDIR} ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/ESMX)
...
```
Here `ESMF_ESMXDIR` points to the ESMX installation location. It is a variable that is made available by the ESMF CMake package.

Once in place, the standard 3 step CMake approach of configure/build/install is used:
  
1. Configure:
```
cmake [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<your-install-location>] -B build
```

2. Build:
```
cmake --build ./build [--parallel] [--verbose]
```

3. Install:
```
cmake --install ./build [--verbose]
```

#### Leveraging the ESMX_Builder utility

The ESMX_Builder is a utility that facilitates building ESMX. It is included with the ESMF installation. It simplifies customization of build aspects via command line options and automatically steps through the CMake configure/build/install sequence.

The `ESMX_Builder` script is installed into the ESMF binary directory within an ESMF installation. For more information on installing ESMF see the [ESMF User's Guide](https://earthsystemmodeling.org/doc/).

If the ESMF binary directory is included in the PATH environment variable then ESMX_Builder can be called from any directory as follows:

```
ESMX_Builder [OPTIONS ...] [ESMX_BUILD_FILE]

options:
  [--esmx-dir=ESMF_ESMXDIR]
  [--esmfmkfile=ESMFMKFILE]
  [--build-dir=BUILD_DIR]
  [--prefix=INSTALL_PREFIX]
  [--disable-comps=DISABLE_COMPS]
  [--build-type=BUILD_TYPE] or [-g]
  [--build-args=BUILD_ARGS]
  [--cmake-args=CMAKE_ARGS]
  [--build-jobs=JOBS]
  [--load-modulefile=MODULEFILE]
  [--load-bashenv=BASHENV]
  [--test[=TEST_ARGS]] or [-t[=TEST_ARGS]]
  [--verbose] or [-v]

where:
  ESMX_BUILD_FILE          ESMX build configuration file
                           (default: esmxBuild.yaml)

  --esmx-dir=ESMF_ESMXDIR  ESMX source directory
                           (default: use ESMF_ESMXDIR in ESMFMKFILE)

  --esmfmkfile=ESMFMKFILE  ESMF makefile fragment
                           (default: use environment)

  --build-dir=BUILD_DIR    build directory
                           (default: build)

  --prefix=INSTALL_PREFIX  installation prefix
                           (default: install)

  --disable-comps=DISABLE_COMPS  disable components (e.g. ESMX_Data)

  --build-type=BUILD_TYPE  build type; valid options are 'debug', 'release', 'relWithDebInfo'
  -g                       (default: release) (-g sets BUILD_TYPE to debug)

  --build-args=BUILD_ARGS  build arguments passed to every component (e.g. -DVAR=val)

  --cmake-args=CMAKE_ARGS  cmake arguments are used to configure cmake while building ESMX
                           (e.g. -DVAR=val)

  --build-jobs=BUILD_JOBS  number of jobs used for building esmx and components

  --load-module=MODULEFILE load modulefile before building

  --load-bashenv=BASHENV   load bash environment file before building

  --test[=TEST_ARGS] or    (beta) run ctest suite for ESMX Driver, pass TEST_ARGS to ctest
  -t[=TEST_ARGS]

  --verbose or -v          build with verbose output
```

This script installs `ESMX_EXE_NAME` into INSTALL_PREFIX/bin.

### ESMX Build Configuration

Regardless which one of the three build options is chosen, the ESMX build system depends on a build file defined by the ESMX_BUILD_FILE variable. When unspecified the ESMX_BUILD_FILE defaults `esmxBuild.yaml`. This is a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file with a very simple format. An example is given here:

```
application:

  disable_comps: ESMX_Data
  cmake_build_args: -DOPTION=VALUE

components:

  TaWaS:
    cmake_config: TaWaS/tawas.cmake
    fort_module:  tawas.mod

  Lumo:
    cmake_config: Lumo/lumo.cmake

tests:

  TestTawasLumo:
    dir: path/to/test/data
```

In this example two components are built into `ESMX_EXE_NAME` explicitly. (Read about [dynamically loading of components from shared objects at run-time](#dynamically-loading-components-from-shared-objects-at-run-time) later.) Each component is given a name, here `TaWaS` and `Lumo`, respectively. Components will be referenced by this *component-name* in the run-time configuration (`esmxRun.yaml`) discussed below.

**CAUTION:** Component names are case-sensitive when used e.g. by default to construct library names, etc. However, they are treated case-insensitive when referenced from within the `esmxRun.yaml` file due to the case-insensitive nature of Fortran when referencing modules via the USE statement.

ESMX comes with a default data component called `ESMX_Data`. It is built into `ESMX_EXE_NAME` by default. This example disables this behavior by setting `disable_comps: ESMX_Data`.

There are *three* top level sections recognized in the ESMX build file. Each is introduced by a specific key using the [YAML](https://yaml.org/) map syntax: `application:`, `components:`, and `tests:`. The value associated with each key is a map of key/value pairs. The available option keys under each top level section are discussed below.

#### Application Options (`application` key)

##### Build Types:

**`auto`** -
The ESMX build system searches for `CMakeLists.txt` (cmake), `Makefile` (make), and a build_script (script) in order in the `source_dir` and uses the first build option it finds. If no build files are found then the component's `build_type` is set to `none`.

**`cmake`** -
The ESMX build system integrates the component's `source_dir` into the ESMX CMake build using the CMake `add_subdirectory()` function. This ensures a shared build environment and consistent package handling between components and ESMX.

**`cmake.external`** -
The ESMX build system attempts to configure/build/install the component externally by calling CMake on the component's `source_dir`. Once built, the ESMX build system searches for the CMake configuration file, Fortran module, and libraries in the `install_prefix` directory.

**`make`** -
The ESMX build system uses GNU Make on the component's `source_dir` without a target. If a specific target is desired then it can be configured using `build_args`. Once built, the ESMX build system searches for libraries and Fortran modules in the `install_prefix` directory.

**`script`** -
The ESMX build system uses `build_script` in the component's `source_dir` to build the component. Once built, the ESMX build system searches for the CMake configuration file, Fortran module, and libraries in the `install_prefix` directory.

**`none`** -
The ESMX build system will not build the component. The ESMX build system searches for the CMake configuration file, Fortran module, and libraries in the `install_prefix` directory.


#### Test Options (`tests` key)

This section contains a key for for each *test-name*, specifying test specific options.

| Option key       | Description / Value options                   | Default         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `dir`            | (beta) directory used for test case data      | *None*          |
| `exe`            | (beta) executable used to run test case       | ESMX_TEST_EXE   |
| `tasks`          | (beta) number of tasks used to run test case  | ESMX_TEST_TASKS |

### ESMX Run Configuration

At startup, the `ESMX_EXE_NAME` executable checks the first command line argument for a filename. If no argument is provided then the filename defaults to `esmxRun.yaml`. This is the ESMX run-time configuration file in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format, providing settings such as the list of components active at run-time, component attributes, the run sequence, as well as application level options.

An example `ESMX Run Configuration` file is given here:


```
ESMX:

  App:
    globalResourceControl:  true
    logKindFlag:            ESMF_LOGKIND_Multi
    logAppendFlag:          false
    logFlush:               true
    startTime:              2012-10-24T18:00:00
    stopTime:               2012-10-24T19:00:00

  Driver:
    componentList:          [ATM, OCN]
    attributes:
      Verbosity: low

    runSequence: |
      @900
        ATM -> OCN
        OCN -> ATM
        ATM
        OCN
      @

ATM:
  model:            Tawas     # model value is case insensitive to match Fortran
  ompNumThreads:    4
  attributes:
    Verbosity:  low
  petList:          [3, [2-0]]  # petList is list of scalars and lists.
                                # each list again can be of scalars and lists
                                # recursively.

OCN:
  model:            lumo
  petList:          [0-1, 3]
  attributes:
    Verbosity:  low
```

On the highest level, `ESMX Run Configuration` is expected to define the `ESMX` key, as well as a key for every component that is listed in the `componentList` found under the `Driver` level. The `ESMX` key is associated with a map containing the `App` and `Driver` keys. The `App` key must be present if `ESMX Run Configuration` is read by the `ESMX_EXE_NAME` executable, but is optional (and will be ignored) in case `esmfRun.yaml` is read by the `esmx_driver`.

#### ESMX/App Options

This section affects the application level.

**CAUTION:** Specifying any of the  `ESMF_RUNTIME_*` keys overrides the corresponding environment variables set in the user's environment.

### Dynamically loading components from shared objects at run-time

There are two options recognized when specifying the value of the `model` field for a component in the `esmxRun.yaml` file:

- First, if the value specified is recognized as a *component-name* provided by any of the components built into the `esmx_app` during build-time, as specified by `esmxBuild.yaml`, the respective component is accessed via its Fortran module.
- Second, if the value does *not* match a build-time dependency, it is assumed to correspond to a shared object file instead. In that case the attempt is made to load the specified shared object file at run-time, and, if successful, is associated with the generic component label. The search order details of the OS dependent dynamic linker apply when looking for the specified shared object file on the system. A convenient way to target a shared object file at a specific location is to use absolute or relative paths, i.e. the value specified in the `model` field contains at least one slash ("/") character. The asterisk character ("*") is supported as a wildcard for the file name suffix of the specified shared object. This allows portability across systems that differ in shared object suffix. The implemented search order is "so", followed by "dylib", and finally "dll", where the first successfully loaded shared object file is used.

## The Unfied ESMX_Driver

The ESMX layer provides access to the `ESMX_Driver` via the public NUOPC Driver API. This means that `ESMX_Driver` can be plugged into a larger NUOPC application as a standard NUOPC component, or alternatively be accessed through the [External NUOPC Interface](https://earthsystemmodeling.org/docs/nightly/develop/NUOPC_refdoc/node3.html#SECTION00038000000000000000).
A good starting point to explore this feature is the [ESMX_ExternalDriverAPIProto](https://github.com/esmf-org/nuopc-app-prototypes/tree/develop/ESMX_ExternalDriverAPIProto) under the NUOPC prototype repository.

### Project integration

The typical situation where `ESMX_Driver` comes into play is where a user application needs to access a NUOPC based system that uses the unified ESMX driver. Assuming the user application uses CMake, integration of ESMX is straight forward. The critical piece required is to add `add_subdirectory()` in the application's `CMakeLists.txt` file to bring in the `${ESMF_ESMXDIR}/Driver` directory, and make the application dependent on target `esmx_driver`. An example for a very simple application is shown:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)

# Where to look for the local Find<Package>.cmake files
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${ESMF_ESMXDIR}/Driver/cmake")

# Find ESMF
find_package(ESMF 8.5.0 MODULE REQUIRED)

# Set compilers consistent with ESMF
set(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER        "${ESMF_F90COMPILER}")
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER            "${ESMF_CXXCOMPILER}")
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER              "${ESMF_CCOMPILER}")

# Project
project(ExternalDriverAPIProto
        VERSION 1.0.0
        LANGUAGES Fortran CXX C
        )

# Add ESMX driver
add_subdirectory(${ESMF_ESMXDIR}/Driver ./ESMX_Driver)

# Create executable
add_executable(externalApp externalApp.F90)
target_include_directories(externalApp PUBLIC ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR})
target_link_libraries(externalApp PUBLIC esmx_driver)

# Install executable
install(
  TARGETS externalApp
  EXPORT externalApp
  RUNTIME DESTINATION bin
  LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
  ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib)
```

The applcation can then be built as typically via cmake commands, only requiring that the `ESMF_ESMXDIR` variable is passed in. It can be convenient to wrap the cmake commands into a GNU Makefile, accessing the `ESMF_ESMXDIR` variable through the `ESMFMKFILE` mechanism.

When executing cmake, the [ESMX_BUILD_FILE](#esmx-build-configuration) can be specified using `-DESMX_BUILD_FILE=<value>`. If ESMX_BUILD_FILE is not defined in the command line arguments then it will default to `esmxBuild.yaml`.

```
include $(ESMFMKFILE)

build/externalApp: externalApp.F90 esmxBuild.yaml
        cmake -S. -Bbuild -DESMF_ESMXDIR=$(ESMF_ESMXDIR) -DESMX_BUILD_FILE="<value>"
        cmake --build ./build
```

### esmxBuild.yaml and esmxRun.yaml

The `esmx_driver` target defined by the `add_subdirectory(${ESMF_ESMXDIR}/Driver ./ESMX_Driver)` has a build-time dependency on the ESMX_BUILD_FILE already discussed under the [ESMX Build Configuration section](#esmx-build-configuration). The identical file can be used when working on the `ESMX_Driver` level.

The run-time configuration needed by `ESMX_Driver` can either be supplied by the user application, or alternatively default to `esmxRun.yaml`. The following rules apply:
- `ESMX_Driver`, at the beginning of its `SetModelServices()` method checks whether the parent level has provided an `ESMF_Config` object by setting the `config` member on the `ESMX_Driver` component. If so, the provided `config` object is used. Otherwise `ESMX_Driver` itself creates `config` from file `esmxRun.yaml`.
- For the case where the `config` object was provided by the parent layer, `ESMX_Driver` does not ingest attributes from `config`. Instead the assumption is made that the parent layer sets the desired attributes on `ESMX_Driver`.
- For the case where the `config` object was loaded from `esmxRun.yaml` by `ESMX_Driver`, the driver ingests attributes from `config`, potentially overriding parent level settings.
- The `ESMX_component_list`, child component, and run sequence information is ingested from `config` as described under the [ESMX Run Configuration section](#esmx-run-configuration).
- If the parent level passes an `ESMF_Clock` object to `ESMX_Driver` during initialize, the driver uses it instead of looking for `startTime` and `stopTime` in `config`.
- For the case where a clock is provided by the parent layer, its `timeStep` is used as the *default* time step of the outer run sequence loop when using the `@*` syntax. If a specific time step is set in the run sequence with `@DT`, then `DT` must be a divisor of the `timeStep` provided by the parent clock.

## ESMX Test System (beta)

The ESMX layer includes a test system based on CTest. This system is still in beta and as it evolves features may be added or removed. When enabled the test system adds a suite of component and system level tests. All tests in the test suite can be executed via `ESMX_Builder -t`. If the `ESMX_Builder` is not used then tests can be added by setting `test: on` under `Application Options`. Tests can be manually executed from each directory in `test_dir` or through executing `ctest` in the `<CMAKE_BINARY_DIR>/Driver` directory.

## ESMX Components

ESMX includes a data component, which can be used for testing NUOPC caps. This component is known as [`ESMX_Data`](Comps/ESMX_Data).

## ESMX Software Dependencies

The ESMX layer has the following dependencies:

- **ESMF Library**: The ESMX layer is part of the ESMF repository. In order to use ESMX as described above, the ESMF library first needs to be built following the instructions for [Building ESMF](https://github.com/esmf-org/esmf#building-esmf).
- **CMake**: v3.22 or greater.
- **Python**: v3.5 or greater.
  - `python3` must be in `$PATH`.
  - `PyYaml` must be installed in the Python environment.

There are many ways to provide a suitable Python environment. One portable way based on [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is shown below.

```
python3 -m venv ESMXenv
source ESMXenv/bin/activate (for Bash)  or   source ESMXenv/bin/activate.csh (for Csh)
pip install pyyaml
... Environment ready for ESMX ...
deactivate
```
