\label{FieldMeta}
The Field metadata is implemented as an ESMF Attribute Package:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Convention: NUOPC
    \item Purpose: Instance
    \item Includes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ESG General
    \end{itemize} 
    \item Description: Basic Field description with connection and time stamp metadata. 
\end{itemize}
