\label{FieldMeta}
The Field metadata is implemented through ESMF\_Info. It can be accessed
using the JSON Pointer "/NUOPC/Instance/" prefix followed by the "Attribute name"
as per the table below. E.g. "StandardName" is accessed using {\tt key="/NUOPC/Instance/StandardName"}.

\begin{longtable}{|p{.3\textwidth}|p{.4\textwidth}|p{.3\textwidth}|}
