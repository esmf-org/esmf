# NUOPC Layer

NUOPC is the **N**ational **U**nified **O**perational **P**rediction **C**apability.

The National Unified Operational Prediction Capability (NUOPC) is a consortium
of Navy, NOAA, and Air Force modelers and their research partners. It aims to
advance the weather prediction modeling systems used by meteorologists, mission
planners, and decision makers. NUOPC partners are working toward a common model
architecture - a standard way of building models - in order to make it easier
to collaboratively build modeling systems.  To this end, they have developed a
NUOPC Layer that defines conventions and templates for using the Earth System
Modeling Framework (ESMF).
