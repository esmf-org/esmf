HI, welcome to ESMPy :)

ESMPy is a Python interface to the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) 
regridding utility.  ESMF is software for
building and coupling weather, climate, and related models.  ESMF has a robust,
parallel and scalable remapping package, used to generate remapping weights.
It can handle a wide variety of grids and options:  logically rectangular grids
and unstructured meshes; regional or global grids; 2D or 3D; and pole and
masking options.  ESMF also has capabilities to read grid information
from NetCDF files in a variety of formats, including the evolving Climate and 
Forecast (CF) GridSpec and UGRID conventions.

ESMPy provides a Grid to represent single-tile logically rectangular coordinate
data, a Mesh for unstructured coordinates, and a LocStream for collections of
unconnected points like observational data streams.
ESMPy supports bilinear, nearest neighbor, higher order patch recovery, 
first-order conservative and second-order conservative regridding. There is 
also an option to ignore unmapped destination points, mask out points on either
the source or destination, choose straight line or great circle paths when using
spherical coordinates and extrapolate data to points outside of the destination
domain. Regridding on the sphere takes place in 3D Cartesian space, so the pole
problem is not an issue as it commonly is with many Earth system grid remapping
softwares. Grid and Mesh objects can be created in 2D or 3D space, and 3D 
conservative regridding is fully supported.

Regridding, also called remapping or interpolation, is the process of changing
the grid underneath field data values while preserving the qualities of the
original data. Different kinds of transformations are appropriate for
different problems. Regridding may be needed when communicating data between
Earth system modeling components such as land and atmosphere, or between
different data sets to support analysis or visualization.

Regridding can be broken into two stages. The first stage is generation of an
interpolation weight matrix that describes how points in the source grid
contribute to points in the destination grid. The second stage is the
multiplication of values on the source grid by the interpolation weight matrix
to produce the appropriate values on the destination grid. ESMPy provides
access to both stages through two separate interfaces.

There are many different interpolation methods, suitable for different problems.
In ESMPy, the basic bilinear option is a two dimensional variant of linear 
interpolation. The higher order patch recovery is a second degree polynomial 
regridding method, which uses a least squares algorithm to calculate the 
polynomial. This method gives better derivatives in the resulting destination 
field than the bilinear. There are two nearest-neighbor methods which map the 
points from one grid to the nearest corresponding point on the other grid, from
either source to destination or vice versa. These are useful for extrapolation 
or categorical fields. 

The first-order conservative regridding is a method designed to preserve the 
integral of the field across the interpolation from source to destination.  It 
uses the proportion of the area of the overlapping source and destination cells
to determine appropriate weights. The second-order conservative method also 
preserves the integral, but uses the source gradient to give a smoother result 
than the first-order conservative. All of these methods can be broken down to a
simple sparse matrix multiplication operation between interpolation weights and
data values.

The "REQUIREMENTS" section below will give information on the software
requirements.

The "INSTALLATION" section gives directions on how to install ESMPy.
(If you just downloaded the ESMF tarball, it is source code and you will
have to build the ESMF library first.)

The "USE" section below will give information on how to import this package.

The "VALIDATION" section below will give information on how to test the package.

The "LIMITATIONS" section has helpful information on which capabilities
can be expected from the current ESMPy functionality.

The "MORE HELP" section will give you links to more documentation and other
information about the ESMF project.

Documentation for the ESMPy library can also be found by running 'pydoc ESMF'
from the terminal prompt in the top level ESMPy directory.


Please contact <esmf_support@list.woc.noaa.gov> with any questions or problems.

================================================================================

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

The following packages are *required* to work with ESMPy:

-- ESMF installation - http://www.earthsystemmodeling.org/esmf_releases/non_public/ESMF_8_0_0/ESMF_usrdoc
-- python - http://python.org/
-- numpy - http://numpy.scipy.org/

The following packages are *optional*:

-- mpi4py - python bindings to MPI, needed to run some of the parallel 
            regridding examples
-- ESMF installation with NetCDF - required to create grids and meshes from file
    - NetCDF must be built as a shared library for ESMPy installation to succeed
-- nose - for nose testing

================================================================================

INSTALLATION:
-------------

Installation of ESMPy requires a pointer to a file named esmf.mk inside of an
ESMF installation.  This file resides in a directory which looks like:

<ESMF_INSTALL_DIR>/lib/lib<g<or>O>/<platform>/esmf.mk

If the ESMFMKFILE flag is set when building ESMPy then it will not need to be
referenced again.  If not, an environment variable of the same name must be set
with the path to the esmf.mk file EVERY time that a new shell is initiated.

The ESMPy build can be installed in a custom location using the
--prefix, --home, or --install-base flags to the install command.  If this
is done, then this location needs to be added to the PYTHONPATH environment
variable in the user's shell EVERY time that a new shell is initiated.  If a
customized install location is not specified, ESMPy will be installed in the 
standard Python package installation directory on that particular machine.

Note: The ESMPy build does not have to be installed to be used.  The 
PYTHONPATH environment variable can simply be pointed to the directory 
containing the ESMF module (esmf/src/addon/ESMPy/src from a default git clone) 
after the build command.

As usual, any command followed by --help should print out some information
on what options are available.

An installation of ESMPy in the default location for Python packages can be done 
with the following command issued from the top level ESMPy directory:

- default Python package installation:

    python setup.py build --ESMFMKFILE=<DIR_TO_esmf.mk>/esmf.mk install

- custom install location:

    python setup.py build --ESMFMKFILE=<DIR_TO_esmf.mk>/esmf.mk

    python setup.py install --prefix=<custom_install_location>

    setenv PYTHONPATH <custom_install_location>/lib/*/site_packages

Please contact esmf_support@list.woc.noaa.gov with any questions or problems.


Anaconda Packages:
------------------

ESMPy conda packages are available through the NESII channel:

    conda install -n esmpy -c nesii -c conda-forge esmpy

================================================================================

USE:
----

To use this package in an external program, import it with:

    import ESMF

================================================================================

VALIDATION:
-----------

The setup.py file can be used to run subsets of the tests individually, like this:

    python setup.py test

    python setup.py test_examples

    python setup.py test_regrid_from_file

    python setup.py test_parallel

    python setup.py test_examples_parallel

    python setup.py test_regrid_from_file_parallel

NOTE: The regrid_from_file tests can take up a lot of memory and bandwidth.  
The "test_regrid_from_file_dryrun" command will simply download the test 
files without actually running them (allowing the stress on the machine to
be applied to bandwidth first, and then memory).

Alternatively, if the nose package is available, the tests can be run with:

    nosetests

Individual tests can be run with nose using the following format:

    nosetests <file>:<test>

e.g.  

    nosetests src/ESMF/test/test_api/test_regrid.py:TestRegrid.test_grid_mesh_regrid


================================================================================

LIMITATIONS:
------------

ESMPy doesn't include many aspects of ESMF, including components, array
interfaces, time management, etc.  The limitations listed here are relative
to ESMF offline and integrated regridding capabilities.

- ESMPy cannot use an ESMF installation that is built with external LAPACK
  support.
- Coordinates cannot be retrieved from the elements of a Mesh. This can affect 
  the ability to set Field values on a source Mesh created from file when using
  conservative regridding.
- Multi-tile Grid support is limited to cubed-sphere grids created on 6 
  processors. A cubed-sphere grid can be created on any number of processors, 
  but only when it is created on 6 processors will the coordinates be 
  retrievable for the entire object. A field created from a
  cubed-sphere grid cannot be written to file in parallel.
- There is no FieldBundle class, only single Fields.

Testing related:
- Nightly regression testing is limited to a small subset of the ESMF test
  platforms, including Darwin and Linux running gfortran with openMPI.
