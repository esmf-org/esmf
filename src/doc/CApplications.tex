The main product delivered by ESMF is the ESMF library that allows application
developers to write programs based on the ESMF Fortran or C APIs. In addition to 
the programming library, ESMF distributions come with a small set of applications
that are of general interest to the community. These applications utilize
the ESMF library to implement features such as printing general information
about the ESMF installation, or generating regrid weight files. The provided
ESMF applications are intended to be used as standard command line tools.

The bundled ESMF applications are built and installed during the usual ESMF 
installation process, which is described in detail in the ESMF User's Guide 
section "Building and Installing the ESMF". After installation, the
applications will be located in the {\tt ESMF\_APPSDIR} directory, which can 
be found as a Makefile variable in the {\tt esmf.mk} file. The {\tt esmf.mk} 
file can be found in the {\tt ESMF\_INSTALL\_LIBDIR} directory after a 
successful installation.  The ESMF User's Guide discusses the {\tt esmf.mk} 
mechanism to access the bundled applications in more detail in section 
"Using Bundled ESMF Applications".

Refer to the "Application" section of the ESMF Fortran reference manual
for more information. In addition, each application supports the standard 
\verb+ --help + command line argument, providing a brief description of 
how to invoke the program.
