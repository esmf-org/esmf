\section{The ESMF Reference Manual for Fortran}

ESMF provides a complete set of Fortran interfaces and
some C and C++ interfaces.  This {\it ESMF Reference Manual} is a listing of 
ESMF standard interfaces for Fortran.\footnote{Since the audience for it is 
small, we have not yet prepared a comprehensive reference manual for C 
or C++.}  

Interfaces are grouped by class.  A class is an object-oriented software 
design construct that embodies 
a specific concept like a physical field.  Superstructure classes 
are listed first in this {\it Manual}, followed by infrastructure 
classes.

The major classes in the ESMF superstructure are Components, which 
typically represent
large pieces of functionality such as models, model couplers, and 
dynamics and physics packages; and States, which are the data structures
used to communicate data between Components.  There are both data
structures and utilities in the ESMF 
infrastructure; classes include Fields, collections of Fields on the 
same grid (called Bundles), Arrays, and utilities for communication,
decomposition, time management, and application configuration.

design the framework consists of two parts, an upper level
{\bf superstructure} layer and a lower-level {\bf infrastructure} layer.
User code is sandwiched between these two layers.}
