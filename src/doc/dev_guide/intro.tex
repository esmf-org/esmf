\subsection{About this Document}
The Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) {\it Software Developer's Guide},
or simply the {\it Guide}, is the reference handbook that describes
the practices, standards, and conventions recommended for ESMF core software
development.  It is updated as needed.

Suggestions on how to improve the {\it Guide} should be sent to 
\htmladdnormallink{esmf\_support@ucar.edu}{mailto:esmf\_support@ucar.edu}.

It includes a link to the ESMF CVS repository, the current release
