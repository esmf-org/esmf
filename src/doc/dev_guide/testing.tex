\subsection{Testing and Validation}
\label{sec:testing}

ESMF software is subject to the following tests:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Unit tests, which are simple per-class tests.
\item System tests, which generally involve inter-component interactions.
\item Use test cases (UTCs), which are tests at realistic problem
sizes (e.g., large data sets, processor counts, grids).
\item Examples that range from simple to complex.
\item Beta testing through preliminary releases.
\end{enumerate}
Unit tests, system tests, and examples are distributed with the
ESMF software.  UTCs, because of their size, are 
stored and distributed separately.  Tests are run nightly,
following a weekly schedule, on a wide variety of platforms.  
Beta testing of ESMF software is done by providing an Internal Release
to customers three months before public release.  

The ESMF team keeps track of test coverage on a per-method basis.
This information is on the {\bf Metrics} page under the {\bf Development}
link on the navigation bar.

Testing information is stored on a {\bf Test and Validation} Web page,
under the {\bf Development} link on the ESMF 
web site.  This Web page includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item separate Web pages for each system test and UTC;
\item links to the {\it Developer's Guide}, SourceForge Tracker, Requirements 
Spreadsheet, and any other pertinent information; and
\item separate Web page for automated regression test information and results.
\end{itemize}

The ESMF is designed to run on several target platforms, in different 
configurations, and is required to interoperate with many combinations 
of application software. Thus our test strategy includes the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item Tests are executed on as many target platforms as possible. 
\item Tests are executed on a variety of programming paradigms
(e.g pure shared memory, pure distributed memory and a mix of both).
\item Tests are executed in multiple configurations (e.g. uni-processor,
multi-processor).
\item The result of each test is a {\tt PASS/FAIL}.  
\item In some cases, for floating point comparisons, an epsilon value
will be used.
\item Tests are implemented for each language interface that is 
supported.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Unit Tests}

Each class in the framework is associated with a suite of unit tests.
Typically the unit tests are stored in one file per class, and are
located near the corresponding source code in a test directory.  The 
framework {\tt make} system will have an option to build and run unit tests.
The user has the option of building either a "sanity check" type test
or an exhaustive suite. The exhaustive tests include tests of many 
functionalities and a variety of valid and invalid input values. The sanity 
check tests are a minimum set of tests to indicate whether, for example, the 
software has been installed correctly. It is the responsibility of the 
software developer to write and execute the unit tests. Unit tests 
are distributed with the framework software.

To achieve adequate unit testing, developers shall attempt to meet the following goals. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Individual procedures will be evaluated with at least one unit
test function.  However, as many test functions as necessary will be
implemented to assure that each procedure works properly.  
\item Developers should unit test their code to the degree possible  
before it is checked into the repository.  It is assumed that 
developers will use stubs as necessary.
\item Variables are tested for acceptable range and precision.
\item Variables are tested for a range of valid values, including boundary
values.
\item Unit tests should verify that error handling works correctly.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{System Tests}

System tests are written to test functionality that spans several 
classes.  The following areas should be addressed in system testing.

\begin{itemize}
\item Design omissions (e.g. incomplete or incorrect behaviors).
\item Associations between objects (e.g. fields, grids, bundles).
\item Control and infrastructure. (e.g. couplers, time management, error handling).
\item Feature interactions or side effects when multiple features are used
simultaneously.
\end{itemize}

The system tester should issue a test log after each software release is tested,
which is recorded on the {\bf Test and Validation} Web page. The test 
log shall
include: a test ID number, a software release ID number, testing environment 
descriptions, a list of test cases executed, results, and any unexpected 
events. Bugs should be documented in the \htmladdnormallink{{\it SourceForge Bug 
Tracker}}{https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group\_id=38089&atid=421185} and 
any bug fixes shall be validated.

\subsubsection{Use Test Cases (UTCs)}

Use Test Cases are problems of realistic size created to test the ESMF
software.  They were initiated when the ESMF team and its users saw that
often ESMF capabilities could pass simple system tests but would fail
out in the field, for real customer problems.  UTCs have realistic
processor counts, data set sizes, and grid and data array sizes.  UTCs are
listed on the {\bf Test \& Validation} page of the ESMF Web site.  They
are not distributed with the ESMF software; instead they are stored in
a separate module in the main repository called {\tt use\_test\_cases}.

\subsubsection{Beta Testing}

ESMF software is released in a beta form, as an Internal Release,
three months before it is publicly released.  This gives users
a chance to test the software and report back any problems to 
support.

\subsubsection{Automated Regression Tests}

The purpose of regression testing is to reveal faults caused by new
or modified software (e.g. side effects, incompatibility between 
releases, and bad bug fixes).  
Regression tests regularly exercise all interfaces of the code on 
all target platforms.  The Integrator runs 
automated nightly builds on a wide variety of machines, listed on the
{\bf Test and Validation} Web site. This site stores log files of the
build results.
The log files are kept on a monthly basis in 
separate directories. For example, the December 2002 directory is named {\tt 0212\_test}. The 
directory contains an {\tt ESMFdailyLog} file which has a one line entry for each platform on 
which the build was attempted indicating whether the build was successful or not. 

The {\tt ESMFdailyLog} file for the current month is available on the {\bf Test and Validation} Web site.

If the build is not successful, then a file containing the build output is stored in 
the:\\
{\tt /fs/projects/css/esmf/esmf\_test/daily\_builds}\\
directory on the NCAR fileserver. The file naming convention for the build output file is:\\
{\tt build\_BOPT\_(day)(platform)ESMF\_ARCH}.\\
For example, if the build fails on longs on the 19th of the month with {\tt BOPT=g},
the file would be called:\\
{\tt build\_g\_19longslinux\_lf95}. 

Email is sent daily to the ESMF core team listing all the platforms on which the build was attempted with a {\tt PASS/FAIL} indication. 

\subsubsection{Testing for Releases}

We provide two types of tar files, the ESMF source and the shared
libraries of the supported platforms. Consequently, there are two test
procedures followed before placing the tar files on the ESMF download Web site. 

The {\bf Source Code Test Procedure} is followed on all the supported
platforms for the particular release.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Verify that the source code builds in both {\tt BOPT=g} and {\tt BOPT=O}.
\item Verify that  the {\tt ESMF\_COUPLED\_FLOW} demonstration executes successfully.
\item Verify that the unit tests run successfully, and that there are no {\tt NON-EXHAUSTIVE} unit tests  failures.
\item Verify that all system tests run successfully. 
\end{enumerate}

The {\bf Shared Libraries Test Procedure} is also followed on all supported
platforms for a release.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Change to the {\tt CoupledFlowEx} directory and execute {\tt gmake}. Verify that the demo runs successfully.
\item Change to the {\tt CoupledFlowSrc} directory and execute {\tt gmake} then {\tt gmake run}. Verify that the demo runs successfully.
\item Change to the {\tt examples} directory and execute {\tt gmake} and {\tt gmake run}. Verify that the example runs successfully.
\end{enumerate}
