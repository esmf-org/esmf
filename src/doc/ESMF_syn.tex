\section{Synopsis}

The following document describes the scope and formal requirements
of the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) -- a NASA sponsored 
high-performance computing project for Earth science modeling and 
data assimilation. The document contains a series of parts.
Each part consists of a series of introductory
sections and then specifications of detailed formal requirements
for that part. The document begins with the {\it General Requirements}
(part {\bf \ref{part:General_Requirements}}). The subsequent parts 
({\bf \ref{part:Superstructure:_Components}} to {\bf \ref{part:Infrastructure_Utilities:_CA}}) 
elaborate in more detail on the content identified in the {\it General Requirements}.
A glossary of terms can be found at the end (part {\bf \ref{part:Glossary}}).
