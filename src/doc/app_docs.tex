\item a brief description of the application;
\item a list of the platforms on which it runs;
\item a list of any initial datasets required to run the code;
\item a list of any external library dependencies and system 
      resources required;
\item a full description of the build procedure;
\item full documentation of ESMF component interfaces, including
      the names and descriptions of any data items that are passed
      through couplers;
\item any other information necessary to build and run the 
      code.
