\subsection{Implementation Language and Language Interoperability Strategy}

The ESMF will have C++ and F90 language bindings.

It is possible to represent the fundamental features of object-oriented 
software -- polymorphism, inheritance and encapsulation -- in a variety of languages, 
including the usual choices for high-performance systems: C, C++ and F90. \footnote{Albeit 
with differing levels of difficulty and effectiveness.}  Perhaps the best evidence for 
this claim is that widely used object-oriented libraries and frameworks have been 
written in each of these languages.  Given the above, we can assume that the architecture 
and design of the ESMF is largely independent of its implementation language.  
In practice we have decided to implement the lower layers 
of the ESMF and some of the higher-level control mechanisms in C++.  The
implementation of fields and grids will be in F90.  We anticipate developing a 
prototype implementation of the fields and grids layer in C++ as well.
The rationale for our decision is presented in the {\it ESMF Implementation Report.}
