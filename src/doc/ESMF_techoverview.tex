\section{Validating an ESMF Build}
\label{sec:TechOver2}

The following subsections go into more detail about how to run the tests and
examples included with the ESMF software. This is the recommended method of
regression testing ESMF, and is routinely used during library code development.
Running the regression tests against an existing ESMF installation is also 
supported, and offers a general way to validate a pre-installed ESMF library.
