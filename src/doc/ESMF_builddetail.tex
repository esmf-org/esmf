\subsection{The ESMF Build System}
\label{sec:make}
For most users the description of the build system in previous
sections should be sufficient.  Some users, however, may wish to have
a more detailed knowledge of the make system either for configuring
different build options or for porting to unsupported platforms.

\subsubsection{General Structure}

The ESMF build system is divided into two parts.  The first is the
series of makefiles located with the source code.  The second is a set
of makefile fragment files designed to be used by the source code
makefiles.  Makefile fragment files are files that contain makefile
syntax defining build rules and actions, but do not constitute a
complete build system.

The main components of the make system are:
\label{sec:BuildOptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item{{\bf Build directories}}

There are two directories containing makefile fragment files used by
the make system.  

The {\tt build} directory contains the generic makefile fragment file
common.mk that is included by the top level makefile in the source
tree.  common.mk contains generic build system settings and build
rules used across all platforms.  A user should have no reason to edit
common.mk.

The {\tt build\_config} directory contains makefile fragments for each
supported platform defining compilers, compiler flags, and the various
other definitions that are necessary to build on each platform.  Files
can also be added to this directory for specific machines where the
build settings are different from the standards of the platform.
One of the files in this directory will be included by the
build/common.mk file depending the values of the environment variables
ESMF\_OS, ESMF\_COMPILER and ESMF\_SITE.  See below for more details
on environment variables.

\item{{\bf Environment Variables}}

The three sets of source codes that the build system supports all need
environment variables set to point to their top level source code
directories.

\begin{description}

\item{ESMF Library} 

To build the ESMF library, ESMF\_DIR needs to be set to the top level ESMF
library source code directory.

\item{Implementation Report} 

The build system needs ESMF\_IMPL\_DIR set to the top level source
code directory of the Implementation Report source tree to build the
report and to build and run the examples.

\item{EVA Applications} 

An EVA source code tree does not contain a copy of the ESMF build
system.  Instead it uses a copy found in an ESMF library source code
tree.  Building the EVA applications requires that ESMF\_EVA\_DIR and
ESMF\_DIR be set.  ESMF\_EVA\_DIR has to be set to the top directory
of the EVA source code.  ESMF\_DIR has to be set to the top directory
of an ESMF source code tree.

\end{description}


\item{{\bf Makefiles}}

Every source tree contains a makefile in its top level directory.  This
makefile includes the common.mk file from the {\tt build} directory.
The top level makefile contains makefile settings specific for the
source code that it is found in.

Each directory in the source tree contains a makefile which includes
the top level makefile.  These local makefiles include definitions that
allow the local files and documents to be built.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Build Configuration}

A single makefile or makefile fragment from the build system never
constitutes a complete set of build rules and settings.  Starting from
the local makefile, successive include commands are used to string
together makefiles and makefile fragments to create a complete system
of build rules and settings.  Configuration of the build system is
done by including a configuration makefile fragment. A configuration for a
specific machine or compiler is referred to as a site configuration.

The string of files included is fairly short.  Makefiles below the top
level makefile include the top level makefile. The top level makefile
includes {\tt build/common.mk} and then {\tt build/common.mk} includes a
configuration file from the {\tt build\_config} directory.  The configuration
files in the {\tt build\_config} directory contain the platform and site
specific build settings.  The os, compiler and site that a file
configures is determined by its name.  The configuration makefile
fragments follow this naming convention:

\begin{verbatim}
    build_config/ESMF_OS.ESMF_COMPILER.ESMF_SITE/build_rules.mk
\end{verbatim}

Where {\tt ESMF\_OS}, {\tt ESMF\_COMPILER} and {\tt ESMF\_SITE} are environment
variables either set by the user or given default values by the build
system. {\tt ESMF\_OS} is the target operating system. If the build is performed
{\ em on} the target system {\tt ESMF\_OS} will typically have the value
returned by the command {\tt uname -s}. {\tt ESMF\_COMPILER} is the compiler
name. {\tt ESMF\_SITE}, if set, is generally the current machine name, the
location, or the organization (e.g. mit, cola).  If there are no site specific
files for a particular platform, then {\tt ESMF\_COMPILER} and {\tt ESMF\_SITE}
will be set to {\tt default}.  Examples:

\begin{verbatim}
    ! Default configuation for IBM AIX systems
    build_config/AIX.default.default/build_rules.mk
    
    ! Linux configuation using lahey compilers.    
    build_config/Linux.lahey.default/build_rules.mk
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Source Code Configuration}

Some of the ESMF C++ and Fortran source files contain preprocessor directives
to configure the source code for specific platforms.  The directives are 
included in the source code and are processed by the C preprocessor (cpp) 
before the source code is compiled.  The directives are used to determine among
other things, the size of variable types.

The ESMF build system provides preprocessor directives in 
{\tt ESMC\_Conf.h} and {\tt ESMF\_Conf.inc} files
that are included in the source code.  The path to these files is

\begin{verbatim}
    build_config/ESMF_OS.ESMF_COMPILER.ESMF_SITE/ESMC_Conf.h
    build_config/ESMF_OS.ESMF_COMPILER.ESMF_SITE/ESMF_Conf.inc
\end{verbatim}

Where {\tt ESMF\_OS}, {\tt ESMF\_COMPILER} and {\tt ESMF\_SITE} are
environment variables set by the user or given default values be the
build system.  Based on the settings of these environment variables,
the build system provides a path to the correct files during
source code compiles.

\subsubsection{Building on New Platforms}

The build system can be ported to other Unix platforms by adding new
makefile fragments and configuration files.  The new makefile fragment 
file has to follow the naming convention used by the existing makefile 
fragment files and be created in the {\tt build\_config} directory. The 
new file will also have to define the same makefile variables as the existing
makefile fragment files. Example:

\begin{verbatim}
      build_config/Linux.pgi.mysite/build_rules.mk
\end{verbatim}

This fragment is included {\it after} the default fragment, so it need
only contain overrides and additional definitions.

See the {\tt README} file in the {\tt build\_config} directory in the
source tree for more detailed information on what files will generally
need to be customized to support a new platform.
