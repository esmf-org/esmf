\section{ESMF\_Regrid}
\label{sec:ESMF_Regrid}

\subsection{Description}

This section describes the file-based regridding command line tool provided by ESMF (for a description of ESMF regridding in general see Section~\ref{sec:regrid}). Regridding, also called remapping or interpolation, is the process of changing the grid that underlies data values while preserving qualities of the original data. Different kinds of transformations are appropriate for different problems. Regridding may be needed when communicating data between Earth system model components such as land and atmosphere, or between different data sets to support operations such as visualization. 

Regridding can be broken into two stages. The first stage is generation of an interpolation weight matrix that describes how points in
the source grid contribute to points in the destination grid. The second stage is the multiplication of values on the source grid by the
interpolation weight matrix to produce values on the destination grid. This is implemented as a parallel sparse matrix multiplication.

The {\tt ESMF\_RegridWeightGen} command line tool described in Section~\ref{sec:ESMF_RegridWeightGen} 
performs the first stage of the regridding process - generate the interpolation weight matrix. 
This tool not only calculates the interpolation weights, it also applies the
weights to a list of variables 
stored in the source grid file and produces the interpolated values on the destination grid. 
The interpolated output variable is written out to the destination grid file.  This tool 
supports three CF compliant file formats: the CF Single Tile grid file format(~\ref{sec:fileformat:gridspec}) for
a logically rectangular grid, the UGRID file
format(~\ref{sec:fileformat:ugrid}) for unstructured grid and the GRIDSPEC
Mosaic file format(~\ref{sec:fileformat:mosaic}) for cubed-sphere grid.  For
the GRIDSPEC Mosaic file format, the data are stored in separate data files,
one file per tile.   
The SCRIP format(~\ref{sec:fileformat:scrip}) and the ESMF unstructured grid format(~\ref{sec:fileformat:esmf}) are not supported because there is no way to define a variable field using these two formats. Currently, the tool only works with 2D grids, the support for the 3D grid will be 
made available in the future release.  The variable array can be up to four dimensions.  The
variable type is currently limited to single or double precision real numbers.  The support for 
other data types, such as integer or short will be added in the future release.  

The user interface of this tool is greatly simplified from {\tt ESMF\_RegridWeightGen}.  User only 
needs to provide two input file names, the source and the destination variable names and the regrid method.  The tool will figure out the type of the grid file automatically based on the attributes of the variable.
If the variable has a {\tt coordinates} attribute, the grid file is a GRIDSPEC file and the value of the 
{\tt coordinates} defines the longitude and latitude variable's names.  For example, following is a simple
GRIDSPEC file with a variable named {\tt PSL} and coordinate variables named {\tt lon} and {\tt lat}.

\label{gridspecexample}
\begin{verbatim}
netcdf simple_gridspec {
dimensions:
      lat = 192 ;
      lon = 288 ;
variables:
      float PSL(lat, lon) ;
         PSL:time = 50. ;
         PSL:units = "Pa" ;
         PSL:long_name = "Sea level pressure" ;
         PSL:cell_method = "time: mean" ;
         PSL:coordinates = "lon lat" ;
      double lat(lat) ;
         lat:long_name = "latitude" ;
         lat:units = "degrees_north" ;
      double lon(lon) ;
         lon:long_name = "longitude" ;
         lon:units = "degrees_east" ;
}
\end{verbatim}

If the variable has a {\tt mesh} attribute and a {\tt location} attribute, the grid file is in UGRID 
format(~\ref{sec:fileformat:ugrid}).  The value of {\tt mesh} attribute is the name of a dummy variable that defines the mesh topology.  If the application performs a conservative regridding, the value of the {\tt location} attribute has to be {\tt face}, otherwise, it has to be {\tt node}.  
This is because ESMF only supports non-conservative regridding on the data stored at the nodes of a ESMF\_Mesh object, and conservative regridding on the data stored at the cells of
a ESMF\_Mesh object.

Here is an example 2D UGRID file:

\label{ugridexample}
\begin{verbatim}
netcdf simple_ugrid {
dimensions:
      node = 4176 ; 
      nele = 8268 ;
      three = 3 ;
      time  = 2 ;
variables:
      float lon(node) ;
         lon:units = "degrees_east" ;
      float lat(node) ;
         lat:units = "degrees_north" ;
      float lonc(nele) ;
         lonc:units = "degrees_east" ;
      float latc(nele) ;
         latc:units = "degrees_north" ;
      int nv(nele, three) ;
         nv:standard_name = "face_node_connectivity" ;
         nv:start_index = 1. ;
      float zeta(time, node) ;
         zeta:standard_name = "sea_surface_height_above_geoid" ;
         zeta:_FillValue = -999. ;
         zeta:location = "node" ;
         zeta:mesh = "fvcom_mesh" ;
      float ua(time, nele) ;
         ua:standard_name = "barotropic_eastward_sea_water_velocity" ;
         ua:_FillValue = -999. ;
         ua:location = "face" ;
         ua:mesh = "fvcom_mesh" ;
      float va(time, nele) ;
         va:standard_name = "barotropic_northward_sea_water_velocity" ;
         va:_FillValue = -999. ;
         va:location = "face" ;
         va:mesh = "fvcom_mesh" ;
      int fvcom_mesh(node) ;
         fvcom_mesh:cf_role = "mesh_topology" ;
         fvcom_mesh:dimension = 2. ;
         fvcom_mesh:locations = "face node" ;
         fvcom_mesh:node_coordinates = "lon lat" ;
         fvcom_mesh:face_coordinates = "lonc latc" ;
         fvcom_mesh:face_node_connectivity = "nv" ;
}
\end{verbatim}

There are three variables defined in the above UGRID file - {\tt zeta} on the node of the mesh, {\tt ua} and
{\tt va} on the face of the mesh.  All three variables have one extra time dimension.  

The GRIDSPEC MOSAIC file(~\ref{sec:fileformat:mosaic}) can be identified by a dummy variable with {\tt
  standard\_name} attribute set to {\tt grid\_mosaic\_spec}.  The data for a
GRIDSPEC Mosaic file are stored in separate files, one tile per file.  The
name of the data file is not specified in the mosaic file.  Therefore,
additional optional argument {\tt --srcdatafile} or {\tt --dstdatafile} is
required to provide the prefix of the datafile.  The datafile is also a CF
compliant NetCDF file.  The complete name of the datafile is
constructed by appending the tilename (defined in the Mosaic file in a
variable specified by the {\tt children} attribute of the dummy variable).
For instance, if the prefix of the datafile is {\tt mosaicdata}, then the
datafile names are {\tt mosaicdata.tile1.nc}, {\tt mosaicdata.tile2.nc},
etc...  using the mosaic file example in \ref{sec:fileformat:mosaic}.  The
path of the datafile is defined by {\tt gridlocation} variable, similar to the
tile files.  To overwrite it, an optional argument {\tt tilefile\_path} can be
specified.  

Following is an example GRIDSPEC MOSAIC datafile:

\begin{verbatim}
netcdf mosaictest.tile1 {
dimensions:
     grid_yt = 48 ;
     grid_xt = 48 ;
     time = UNLIMITED ; // (12 currently)
variables:
     float area_land(grid_yt, grid_xt) ;
        area_land:long_name = "area in the grid cell" ;
        area_land:units = "m2" ;
     float evap_land(time, grid_yt, grid_xt) ;
        evap_land:long_name = "vapor flux up from land" ;
        evap_land:units = "kg/(m2 s)" ;
        evap_land:coordinates = "geolon_t geolat_t" ;
     double geolat_t(grid_yt, grid_xt) ;
        geolat_t:long_name = "latitude of grid cell centers" ;
        geolat_t:units = "degrees_N" ;
     double geolon_t(grid_yt, grid_xt) ;
        geolon_t:long_name = "longitude of grid cell centers" ;
        geolon_t:units = "degrees_E" ;
     double time(time) ;
        time:long_name = "time" ;
        time:units = "days since 1900-01-01 00:00:00" ;
}
\end{verbatim}

This is a database for the C48 Cubed Sphere grid defined in
\ref{sec:fileformat:mosaic}.  Note currently we assume that the data are
located at the center stagger of the grid.  The coordinate variables {\tt
  geolon\_t} and {\tt geolat\_t} should be identical to the center coordinates
defined in the corresponding tile files. They are not used to create the
multi-tile grid.  For this application, they are only used to construct the
analytic field to check the correctness of the regridding results if {\tt
  --check} argument is given. 

If the variable specified for the destination file does not already exist in the file, the file type is determined as follows:  
First search for a variable that has a {\tt cf\_role} attribute of value {\tt mesh\_topology}.  If successful,
the file is a UGRID file.  The destination variable will be created on the nodes if the regrid method is 
non-conservative and an optional argument {\tt dst\_loc} is set to {\tt
  corner}.  Otherwise, the destination variable will be created
on the face.  If the destination file is not a UGRID file, check if there is a variable with its {\tt units} attribute set to {\tt degrees\_east} and another variable with it's {\tt units} attribute set to {\tt degrees\_west}.  If such a pair is found, 
the file is a GRIDSPEC file and the above two variables will be used as the coordinate variables for the 
variable to be created.  If more than one pair of coordinate variables are found in the file, the application 
will fail with an error message.  

If the destination 
variable exists in the destination grid file, it has to have the same number of dimensions and the same type as the source variable. Except for the latitude and longitude dimensions, the size of 
the destination variable's extra dimensions (e.g., time and vertical layers) has to match with the 
source variable.   If the destination variable does not exist in the destination grid file, a
new variable will be created with the same type and matching dimensions as the source variable.
All the attributes of the source variable will be copied to the destination variable except those
related to the grid definition (i.e. {\tt coordinates} attribute if the destination file is in  
GRIDSPEC or MOSAIC format or {\tt mesh} and {\tt location} attributes if the destination file is in UGRID format.

Additional rules beyond the CF convention are adopted to determine whether there is a time dimension defined
in the source and destination files.  In this application, only a dimension with a name {\tt time} is 
considered as a time dimension.
If the source variable has a {\tt time} dimension and the destination variable is not already defined, 
the application first checks if there is a {\tt time} dimension defined in the destination file.  If so, 
the values of the {\tt time} dimension in both files have to be identical.  If the time dimension values don't match, the application
terminates with an error message.  The application does not check the existence of a {\tt time} variable 
or if the {\tt units} attribute of the {\tt time} variable match in two input files.  If the destination 
file does not have a {\tt time} dimension, it will be created.  UNLIMITED time dimension is allowed in the
source file, but the {\tt time} dimension created in the destination file is not UNLIMITED.

This application requires the NetCDF library to read the grid files and write out the interpolated variables.  To compile ESMF with
the NetCDF library, please refer to the "Third Party Libraries" Section in the ESMF User's Guide for more information.

Internally this application uses the ESMF public API to perform regridding.
If a source or destination grid is logically rectangular, then {\tt ESMF\_GridCreate()}(~\ref{API:GridCreateFrmNCFile}) is used to create an ESMF\_Grid object from the file. The coordinate variables are stored
at the center stagger location ({\tt ESMF\_STAGGERLOC\_CENTER}).  If the application performs a 
conservative regridding, the {\tt addCornerStager} argument is set to {\tt TRUE} and the bound variables in the grid file will
be read  in and stored at the corner stagger location ({\tt ESMF\_STAGGERLOC\_CORNER}).  If the variable has an {\tt \_FillValue} attribute defined, a mask will be generated using the missing values of the variable. 
The data variable is defined as a ESMF\_Field object at the center stagger location ({\tt ESMF\_STAGGERLOC\_CENTER}) of the grid.   

If the source grid is an unstructured grid and the the regrid method is nearest neighbor, or if the destination grid 
is unstructured and the regrid method is non-conservative, {\tt ESMF\_LocStreamCreate()}(~\ref{locstream:createfromfile} is used to create an ESMF\_LocStream object.  Otherwise,
{\tt ESMF\_MeshCreate()}(~\ref{API:MeshCreateFromFile}) is used to create an ESMF\_Mesh object for the unstructured 
input grids.  Currently, only the 2D unstructured grid is supported.
If the application performs a conservative regridding, the variable has to be defined on the face of the mesh cells, i.e., its {\tt location} attribute has to be set to {\tt face}.  Otherwise, the variable has to be 
defined on the node and its ({\tt location} attribute is set to {\tt node}).

If a source or a destination grid is a Cubed Sphere grid defined in GRIDSPEC
MOSAIC file format, {\tt
  ESMF\_GridCreateMosaic()}(~\ref{API:GridCreateMosaicReg}) will be used to create a multi-tile ESMF\_Grid
object from the file.  The coordinates at the center and the corner stagger in
the tile files will be stored in the grid.  The data has to be located at the
center stagger of the grid.
 
Similar to the {\tt ESMF\_RegridWeightGen} command line tool (Section~\ref{sec:ESMF_RegridWeightGen}), this application supports
bilinear, patch, nearest neighbor, first-order and second-order conservative interpolation. The descriptions of different 
interpolation methods can be found at Section~\ref{sec:regrid} and Section~\ref{sec:ESMF_RegridWeightGen}. 
It also supports different pole methods for non-conservative interpolation and allows user to choose to 
ignore the errors when some of the destination points cannot be mapped by any source points. 

If the optional argument {\tt --check} is given, the interpolated fields will
be checked agaist a synthetic field defined as follows:

\subsection{Usage}\label{sec:fileregridusage}

The command line arguments are all keyword based.  Both the long keyword prefixed with \verb+ '--' + or the
one character short keyword prefixed with {\tt '-'} are supported.  The format to run the command line tool is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}

        [--no_log]
        [--help|-h]
        [--version]
        [-V]
where
  --source or -s      - a required argument specifying the source grid
                        file name

  --destination or -d - a required argument specifying the destination
                        grid file name

  --src_var           - a required argument specifying the variable names 
                        in the src grid file to be interpolated from.  If more
                        than one, separated them with comma.

  --dst_var           - a required argument specifying the variable names 
                        to be interpolated to.  If more than one, separated 
                        them with comma. The variable may or may not 
                        exist in the destination grid file.

  --srcdatafile       - If the source grid is a GRIDSPEC MOSAIC grid, the data 
                        is stored in separate files, one per tile. srcdatafile
                        is the prefix of the source data file.  The filename
                        is srcdatafile.tilename.nc, where tilename is the tile 
                        name defined in the MOSAIC file.

  --dstdatafile       - If the destination grid is a GRIDSPEC MOSAIC grid, the data 
                        is stored in separate files, one per tile. dstdatafile
                        is the prefix of the destination data file.  The filename
                        is dstdatafile.tilename.nc, where tilename is the tile 
                        name defined in the MOSAIC file.

  --tilefile_path    - the alternative file path for the tile files and the
                        data files when either the source or the destination grid
                        is a GRIDSPEC MOSAIC grid.  The path can be either relative
                        or absolute.  If it is relative, it is relative to the
                        working directory.  When specified, the gridlocation variable
                        defined in the Mosaic file will be ignored. 

    --dst_loc         - an optional argument that specifies whether the destination
                        variable is located at the center or the corner of the grid
                        if the destination variable does not exist in the destination
                        grid file. This flag is only required for non-conservative
                        regridding when the destination grid is in UGRID format.
                        For all other cases, only the center location is supported
                        that is also the default value if this argument is not specified.

  --method or -m      - an optional argument specifying which interpolation
                        method is used. The value can be one of the following:

                        bilinear   - for bilinear interpolation, also the
                                     default method if not specified.
                        patch      - for patch recovery interpolation
                        nearstdtos - for nearest destination to source interpolation
                        nearststod - for nearest source to destination interpolation
                        conserve   - for first-order conservative interpolation

  --pole or -p        - an optional argument indicating what to do with
                        the pole.
                        The value can be one of the following:

                        none  - No pole, the source grid ends at the top
                                (and bottom) row of nodes specified in
                                <source grid>.
                        all   - Construct an artificial pole placed in the
                                center of the top (or bottom) row of nodes,
                                but projected onto the sphere formed by the
                                rest of the grid. The value at this pole is
                                the average of all the pole values. This
                                is the default option.

                        teeth - No new pole point is constructed, instead
                                the holes at the poles are filled by
                                constructing triangles across the top and
                                bottom row of the source Grid. This can be
                                useful because no averaging occurs, however,
                                because the top and bottom of the sphere are
                                now flat, for a big enough mismatch between
                                the size of the destination and source pole
                                regions, some destination points may still
                                not be able to be mapped to the source Grid.

                        <N>   - Construct an artificial pole placed in the
                                center of the top (or bottom) row of nodes,
                                but projected onto the sphere formed by the
                                rest of the grid. The value at this pole is
                                the average of the N source nodes next to
                                the pole and surrounding the destination
                                point (i.e.  the value may differ for each
                                destination point. Here N ranges from 1 to
                                the number of nodes around the pole.

    --ignore_unmapped
           or
           -i         - ignore unmapped destination points. If not specified
                        the default is to stop with an error if an unmapped
                        point is found.

    --ignore_degenerate - ignore degenerate cells in the input grids. If not specified
                        the default is to stop with an error if an degenerate
                        cell is found.

    -r                - an optional argument specifying that the source and
                        destination grids are regional grids.  If the argument
                        is not given, the grids are assumed to be global.

    --src_regional    - an optional argument specifying that the source is
                        a regional grid and the destination is a global grid.

    --dst_regional    - an optional argument specifying that the destination
                        is a regional grid and the source is a global grid.

    --check           - Check the correctness of the interpolated destination 
                        variables against an analytic field. The source variable 
                        has to be synthetically constructed using the same analytic
                        method in order to perform meaningful comparison.
                        The analytic field is calculated based on the coordinate
                        of the data point.  The formular is as follows:
                        data(i,j,k,l)=2.0+cos(lat(i,j))**2*cos(2.0*lon(i,j))+(k-1)+2*(l-1)
                        The data field can be up to four dimensional with the
                        first two dimension been longitude and latitude.
                        The mean relative error between the destination and 
                        analytic field is computed.

     --no_log         - Turn off the ESMF error log.

     --help or -h     - Print the usage message and exit.

     --version        - Print ESMF version and license information and exit.

     -V               - Print ESMF version number and exit.
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Examples}

The example below regrids the node variable {\tt zeta} defined in the sample UGRID file(\ref{ugridexample}) to 
the destination grid defined in the sample GRIDSPEC file(\ref{gridspecexample}) using bilinear regridding
method and write the interpolated data into a variable named {\tt zeta}.  

\begin{verbatim}

  mpirun -np 4 ESMF_Regrid -s simple_ugrid.nc -d simple_gridspec.nc \
                --src_var zeta --dst_var zeta

\end{verbatim}

In this case, the destination variable does not exist in {\tt simple\_ugrid.nc} and the {\tt time}
dimension is not defined in the destination file.  The resulting output file has a new time dimension and a new variable {\tt zeta}.
The attributes from the source variable {\tt zeta} are copied to the destination variable except for 
{\tt mesh} and {\tt location}.  A new attribute {\tt coordinates} is created for the destination variable to
specify the names of the coordinate variables.  The header of the output file looks like:

\begin{verbatim}
netcdf simple_gridspec {
dimensions:
      lat = 192 ;
      lon = 288 ;
      time = 2  ;
variables:
      float PSL(lat, lon) ;
         PSL:time = 50. ;
         PSL:units = "Pa" ;
         PSL:long_name = "Sea level pressure" ;
         PSL:cell_method = "time: mean" ;
         PSL:coordinates = "lon lat" ;
      double lat(lat) ;
         lat:long_name = "latitude" ;
         lat:units = "degrees_north" ;
      double lon(lon) ;
         lon:long_name = "longitude" ;
         lon:units = "degrees_east" ;
      float zeta(time, lat, lon) ;
         zeta:standard_name = "sea_surface_height_above_geoid" ;
         zeta:_FillValue = -999. ;
         zeta:coordinates = "lon lat" ;
}
\end{verbatim}
  
The next example shows the command to do the same thing as the previous example but for a 
different variable {\tt ua}.  Since {\tt ua} is defined on the face, we can only do a conservative 
regridding.

\begin{verbatim}

  mpirun -np 4 ESMF_Regrid -s simple_ugrid.nc -d simple_gridspec.nc \
               --src_var ua --dst_var ua -m conserve

\end{verbatim}
