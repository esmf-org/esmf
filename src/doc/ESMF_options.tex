{\tt type(ESMF\_NormType\_Flag)}

The valid values are:
 \begin{description}
\item [ESMF\_NORMTYPE\_DSTAREA]
 Destination area normalization. Here the weights are calculated by dividing the area of overlap of the source and 
 destination cells by the area of the entire destination cell. In other words, the weight is the fraction of the 
 entire destination cell which overlaps with the given source cell. 
\item [ESMF\_NORMTYPE\_FRACAREA]
   Fraction area normalization. Here in addition to the weight calculation done for destination area normalization 
({\tt ESMF\_NORMTYPE\_DSTAREA}) the weights are also divided by the fraction that the destination cell overlaps with
  the entire source grid. In other words, the weight is the fraction of just the part of the destination cell that

\end{description}


\subsection{ESMF\_PIN}
This flag is documented in section \ref{const:pin_flag}.

\subsection{ESMF\_POLEKIND}
This flag is documented in section \ref{const:polekind}.

\subsection{ESMF\_POLEMETHOD}
\label{const:polemethod}

{\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}  
\begin{sloppypar}
When interpolating between two Grids which have been mapped to a sphere these can be used to specify the type of artificial pole to create on the source Grid during interpolation. Creating the pole allows destination points above the top row or below the bottom row of the source Grid to still be mapped.
\end{sloppypar}

The type of this flag is:

{\tt type(ESMF\_PoleMethod\_Flag)}

The valid values are:
\begin{description}
\item [ESMF\_POLEMETHOD\_NONE]
      No pole. Destination points which lie above the top or below the bottom row of the source Grid won't be mapped. 
\item [ESMF\_POLEMETHOD\_ALLAVG]
      Construct an artificial pole placed in the center of the top (or bottom) row of nodes, but projected onto the sphere formed by the rest of the grid. The value at this pole is the average of all the source values surrounding the pole.
\item [ESMF\_POLEMETHOD\_NPNTAVG] Construct an artificial pole placed in the center of the top (or bottom) row of nodes, but projected onto the sphere formed by the rest of the grid. The value at this pole is the average of the N source nodes next to the pole and surrounding the destination point (i.e. the value may differ for each destination point). Here N is set by using the {\tt regridPoleNPnts} parameter and ranges from 1 to the number of nodes around the pole. This option is useful for interpolating values which may be zeroed out by averaging around the entire pole (e.g. vector components). 
\item [ESMF\_POLEMETHOD\_TEETH]
    No new pole point is constructed, instead the holes at the poles are filled by constructing triangles across the top and bottom row of the source Grid. This can be useful because no averaging occurs, however, because the top and bottom of the sphere are now flat, for a big enough mismatch between the size of the destination and source pole holes, some destination points may still not be able to be mapped to the source Grid. 
\end{description}

\subsection{ESMF\_REDUCE}
\label{const:reduce}
{\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}
Indicates reduce operation.

The type of this flag is:

{\tt type(ESMF\_Reduce\_Flag)}

The type of this flag is:

{\tt type(ESMF\_RegridMethod\_Flag)}

The valid values are:
\begin{description}
\item [ESMF\_REGRIDMETHOD\_BILINEAR]
      Bilinear interpolation. Destination value is a linear combination of the source values in the cell which contains the destination point. The weights for the linear combination are based on the distance of destination point from each source value. 
\item [ESMF\_REGRIDMETHOD\_PATCH]
      Higher-order patch recovery interpolation. Destination value is a weighted average of 2D polynomial patches constructed from cells surrounding the source cell which contains the destination point. This method typically results in better approximations to values and derivatives than bilinear. However, because of its larger stencil, it also results in a much larger interpolation matrix (and thus routeHandle) than the bilinear. 
\item [ESMF\_REGRIDMETHOD\_NEAREST\_STOD]
      In this version of nearest neighbor interpolation each destination point is mapped to the closest source point. A given source point may go to multiple destination points, but no destination point will receive input from more than one source point. 
\item [ESMF\_REGRIDMETHOD\_NEAREST\_DTOS]
      In this version of nearest neighbor interpolation each source point is mapped to the closest destination point. A given destination point may receive input from multiple source points, but no source point will go to more than one destination point. 
\item [ESMF\_REGRIDMETHOD\_CONSERVE]
      First-order conservative interpolation. The main purpose of this method is to preserve the integral of the field between the source and destination. 
      Will typically give a less accurate approximation to the individual field values than the bilinear or patch methods. The value of a destination cell is calculated as the weighted sum of the values of the source cells that it overlaps. The weights are determined by the amount the source cell overlaps the destination cell. Needs corner coordinate values to be provided in the Grid. Currently only works for Fields created on the Grid center stagger or the Mesh element location. 
\item [ESMF\_REGRIDMETHOD\_CONSERVE\_2ND]
      Second-order conservative interpolation. As with first-order, preserves the integral of the value between the source and destination. However, typically produces a smoother more accurate result than first-order. Also like first-order, the value of a destination cell is calculated as the weighted sum of the values of the source cells that it overlaps. However, second-order also includes additional terms to take into account the gradient of the field across the source cell. Needs corner coordinate values to be provided in the Grid. Currently only works for Fields created on the Grid center stagger or the Mesh element location.

\subsection{ESMF\_REGRIDSTATUS}
\label{opt:regridstatus}

{\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}  
 These values can be output during regridding (e.g. from {\tt ESMF\_FieldRegridStore()} via the {\tt dstStatusField} argument). They indicate the status of each destination location.

The type of this flag is:

{\tt integer(ESMF\_KIND\_I4)}

The valid values for all regrid methods are:
\begin{description}
\item [ESMF\_REGRIDSTATUS\_DSTMASKED] The destination location is masked, so no regridding has been peformed on it. 
\item [ESMF\_REGRIDSTATUS\_SRCMASKED] The destination location is within a masked part of the source grid, so no regridding has been performed on it. 
\item [ESMF\_REGRIDSTATUS\_OUTSIDE] The destination location is outside the source grid, so no regridding has been performed on it. 
\item [ESMF\_REGRIDSTATUS\_MAPPED] The destination location is within the unmasked source grid, and so has been regridded (i.e. there is an entry for it within the factorIndexList or routeHandle). 
\item [ESMF\_REGRIDSTATUS\_EXMAPPED] The destination location was not within the unmasked source grid, and so typically it wouldn't be regridded. However, extrapolation was used, and so it has been regridded (i.e. there is an entry for it within the factorIndexList or routeHandle). 
\end{description}

In addition to the above, regridding using the conservative method can result in other values. The reason for this is that in that method one destination cell can overlap multiple source cells, so a single destination can have a combination of values.  
The following are the additional values that apply to the conservative method:
\begin{description}
\item [ESMF\_REGRIDSTATUS\_SMSK\_OUT] The destination cell overlaps a masked source cell, and extends outside the source grid. 
\item [ESMF\_REGRIDSTATUS\_SMSK\_MP] The destination cell overlaps a masked source cell, and an unmasked source cell. (Because it overlaps with the unmasked source grid, there will be an entry for the destination cell within the factorIndexList or routeHandle).  
\item [ESMF\_REGRIDSTATUS\_OUT\_MP] The destination cell overlaps an unmasked source cell, and extends outside the source grid.  (Because it overlaps with the unmasked source grid, there will be an entry for the destination cell within the factorIndexList or routeHandle). 
\item [ESMF\_REGRIDSTATUS\_SMSK\_OUT\_MP] The destination cell overlaps a masked source cell, an unmasked source cell, and extends outside the source grid. (Because it overlaps with the unmasked source grid, there will be an entry for the destination cell within the factorIndexList or routeHandle).  
\end{description}


\subsection{ESMF\_ROUTESYNC}
\label{const:routesync}
{\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}  
\begin{sloppypar}
Switch between blocking and non-blocking execution of RouteHandle based
communication calls. Every RouteHandle based communication method contains
an optional argument {\tt routesyncflag} that is of type {\tt ESMF\_RouteSync\_Flag}.
\end{sloppypar}

The type of this flag is:

{\tt type(ESMF\_RouteSync\_Flag)}

The valid values are:
\begin{description}

\item [ESMF\_ROUTESYNC\_BLOCKING]
         Execute a precomputed communication pattern in blocking mode. This
         mode guarantees that when the method returns all PET-local data
         transfers, both in-bound and out-bound, have finished. 
\item [ESMF\_ROUTESYNC\_NBSTART]
         \begin{sloppypar}
         Start executing a precomputed communication pattern in non-blocking
         mode. When a method returns from being called in this mode, it
         guarantees that all PET-local out-bound data has been transferred.
         It is now safe for the user to overwrite out-bound data elements.
         No guarantees are made for in-bound data elements at this stage. It is
         unsafe to access these elements until a call in
         {\tt ESMF\_ROUTESYNC\_NBTESTFINISH} mode has been issued and has returned
         with {\tt finishedflag} equal to .true., or a call in
         {\tt ESMF\_ROUTESYNC\_NBWAITFINISH} mode has been issued and has returned.
         \end{sloppypar}
\item [ESMF\_ROUTESYNC\_NBTESTFINISH]
         Test whether the transfer of data of a precomputed communication
         pattern, started with {\tt ESMF\_ROUTESYNC\_NBSTART}, has completed.
         Finish up as much as possible and set the {\tt finishedflag} to 
         {\tt .true.} if {\em all} data operations have completed, or
         {\tt .false.} if there are still outstanding transfers. Only after
         a {\tt finishedflag} equal to {\tt .true.} has been returned is it
         safe to access any of the in-bound data elements.
\item [ESMF\_ROUTESYNC\_NBWAITFINISH]
         Wait (i.e. block) until the transfer of data of a precomputed
         communication pattern, started with {\tt ESMF\_ROUTESYNC\_NBSTART}, has
         completed. Finish up {\em all} data operations and set the returned 
         {\tt finishedflag} to {\tt .true.}. It is safe to access any of the
         in-bound data elements once the call has returned.
\item [ESMF\_ROUTESYNC\_CANCEL]
         Cancel outstanding transfers for a precomputed communication pattern.
\end{description}

\subsection{ESMF\_STAGGERLOC}
This flag is documented in section \ref{const:staggerloc}.

\subsection{ESMF\_STARTREGION}
\label{const:startregion}
{\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}
Specifies the start of the effective halo region of an Array or Field object.

The type of this flag is:

{\tt type(ESMF\_StartRegion\_Flag)}

The valid values are:
\begin{description}
\item [ESMF\_STARTREGION\_EXCLUSIVE]
      Region of elements that are exclusively owned by the local DE.
\item [ESMF\_STARTREGION\_COMPUTATIONAL]
      User defined region, greater or equal to the exclusive region.
\end{description}

\subsection{ESMF\_STATEINTENT}
This flag is documented in section \ref{const:stateintent}.

\subsection{ESMF\_STATEITEM}
This flag is documented in section \ref{const:stateitem}.

\subsection{ESMF\_SYNC}
\label{const:sync}
{\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}  
Indicates method blocking behavior and PET synchronization for VM communication
methods, as well as for standard Component methods, such as Initialize(), Run() 
and Finalize().

For VM communication calls the {\tt ESMF\_SYNC\_BLOCKING} and {\tt ESMF\_SYNC\_NONBLOCKING}
modes provide behavior that is practically identical to the blocking and
non-blocking communication calls familiar from MPI.

The details of how the blocking mode setting affects Component methods are
more complex. This is a consequence of the fact that ESMF Components can be
executed in threaded or non-threaded mode. However, in the default,
non-threaded case, where an ESMF application runs as a pure MPI or mpiuni
program, most of the complexity is removed.

See the {\bf VM} item in \ref{sec:spatialclasses} for an
explanation of the PET and VAS concepts used in the following
descriptions.
         
The type of this flag is:

{\tt type(ESMF\_Sync\_Flag)}

The valid values are:
\begin{description}

\item [ESMF\_SYNC\_BLOCKING]
         {\em Communication calls:} The called method will block until all
         (PET-)local operations are complete. After the return of a blocking
         communication method it is safe to modify or use all participating
         local data.
         
         {\em Component calls:} The called method will block until all PETs of
         the VM have completed the operation.
         
         For a non-threaded, pure MPI
         component the behavior is identical to calling a barrier before 
         returning from the method. Generally this kind of rigid 
         synchronization is not the desirable mode of operation for an MPI
         application, but may be useful for application debugging.
         In the opposite case, where all PETs of the component are running as
         threads in shared memory, i.e. in a single VAS, strict synchronization
         of all PETs is required to prevent race conditions.

\item [ESMF\_SYNC\_VASBLOCKING]
         {\em Communication calls:} Not available for communication calls.
         
         {\em Component calls:} The called method will block each PET until
         all operations in the PET-local VAS have completed. 
         
         This mode is a combination of {\tt ESMF\_SYNC\_BLOCKING} and
         {\tt ESMF\_SYNC\_NONBLOCKING} modes. It provides a default setting 
         that leads to the typically desirable behavior for pure MPI 
         components as well as those that share address spaces between PETs.
         
         For a non-threaded, pure MPI component each PET returns
         independent of the other PETs. This is generally the expected 
         behavior in the pure MPI case where calling into a component method is
         practically identical to a subroutine call without extra 
         synchronization between the processes.
         
\begin{sloppypar}
         In the case where some PETs of the component are running as
         threads in shared memory {\tt ESMF\_SYNC\_VASBLOCKING} becomes identical
         to {\tt ESMF\_SYNC\_BLOCKING} within thread groups, to prevent race
         conditions, while there is no synchronization between the thread
         groups.
\end{sloppypar}
         
\item [ESMF\_SYNC\_NONBLOCKING]
         {\em Communication calls:} The called method will not block but 
         returns immediately after initiating the requested operation. It is
         unsafe to modify or use participating local data before all local
         operations have completed. Use the {\tt ESMF\_VMCommWait()} or
         {\tt ESMF\_VMCommQueueWait()} method to block the local PET until
         local data access is safe again. 

         {\em Component calls:} The behavior of this mode is fundamentally
         different for threaded and non-threaded components,
         independent on whether the components use shared memory or not.
         The {\tt ESMF\_SYNC\_NONBLOCKING} mode is the most complex mode for
         calling component methods and should only be used if the extra
         control, described below, is absolutely necessary.
         
\begin{sloppypar}
         For non-threaded components (the ESMF default)
         calling a component method with {\tt ESMF\_SYNC\_NONBLOCKING}
         is identical to calling it with {\tt ESMF\_SYNC\_VASBLOCKING}. However,
         different than for {\tt ESMF\_SYNC\_VASBLOCKING}, a call to
         {\tt ESMF\_GridCompWait()} or {\tt ESMF\_CplCompWait()} is
         required in order to deallocate memory internally allocated for the
         {\tt ESMF\_SYNC\_NONBLOCKING} mode.
\end{sloppypar}
         
         For threaded components the calling PETs
         of the parent component will not be blocked and return immediately
         after initiating the requested child component method. In this
          scenario parent and child components will run concurrently in
         identical VASs. This is the most complex mode of operation.
         It is unsafe to modify or use VAS local data that
         may be accessed by concurrently running components until the child
         component method has completed. Use the appropriate
         {\tt ESMF\_GridCompWait()} or {\tt ESMF\_CplCompWait()} method to
         block the local parent PET until the child component method has
         completed in the local VAS.
\end{description}


\subsection{ESMF\_TERMORDER}
\label{const:termorderflag}
{\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}  
Specifies the order of source terms in a destination sum, e.g. during sparse
matrix multiplication.

The type of this flag is:

{\tt type(ESMF\_TermOrder\_Flag)}

The valid values are:
\begin{description}

\item [ESMF\_TERMORDER\_SRCSEQ]
         The source terms are in strict ascending order according to
         their source sequence index.
\item [ESMF\_TERMORDER\_SRCPET]
         The source terms are first ordered according to their distribution
         across the source side PETs: for each destination PET the source PET
         order starts with the localPet and decrements from there, modulo
         petCount, until all petCount PETs are accounted for. The term order
         within each source PET is given by the source term sequence index.
\item [ESMF\_TERMORDER\_FREE]
         There is no prescribed term order. The source terms may be summed in 
         any order that optimizes performance.
\end{description}


\subsection{ESMF\_TYPEKIND}
\label{const:typekind}

{\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}

	operation that are not mapped by corresponding source points.
	\item[ESMF\_UNMAPPEDACTION\_IGNORE]
