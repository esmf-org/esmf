\section{How to Contact User Support and Find Additional Information}
\label{sec:Support}
The ESMF team can provide assistance in using the framework in your
applications.
For user support, please contact 
\htmladdnormallink{esmf\_support@ucar.edu}{mailto:esmf_support@ucar.edu}.  

More information on the ESMF project as a whole is available on the 
ESMF website, \htmladdnormallink{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu}{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu}.  
The website includes release notes and known bugs for each version of the
framework, supported platforms, project history, values, and metrics, related projects,
the ESMF management structure, and much more.  Those curious about specific 
interfaces should refer to the \htmladdnormallink
{{\it ESMF Reference Manual for Fortran}}{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu/esmf_releases/public/last/ESMF_refdoc}, which contains a detailed listing and description of 
the ESMF API (this version of the document corresponds to the last public version of the framework).  Also available on the ESMF website is the
\htmladdnormallink{{\it ESMF Developer's Guide}}{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu/documents/dev_guide} 
that details our project procedures and conventions.
