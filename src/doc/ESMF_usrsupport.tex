\section{How to Contact User Support and Find Additional Information}
\label{sec:Support}
The ESMF team can provide assistance in using the framework in your
applications.
For user support, please contact 
\htmladdnormallink{esmf\_support@ucar.edu}{mailto:esmf_support@ucar.edu}.  

While this version of the framework is ready to be incorporated
into research versions of user codes, it is still too young to be 
considered a viable infrastructure for operational or production codes.
Over the next year of development we expect to improve performance, 
reliability, and add additional functionality.

More information on the ESMF project as a whole is available on the 
ESMF website, \htmladdnormallink{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu}{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu}.  
The website includes a description of ESMF testbed applications, related projects,
the ESMF management structure, and much more.  Those curious about specific 
interfaces should refer to the \htmladdnormallink
{{\it ESMF Reference Manual for Fortran90}}{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu/esmf_docs/
ESMF_refdoc}, which contains a detailed listing and description of 
the ESMF API.  Other documents available on the ESMF site include an exhaustive
\htmladdnormallink{{\it Requirements Document}}{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu/esmf_docs/ESMF_reqdoc} 
and an \htmladdnormallink{{\it Architecture Document}}
{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu/esmf_docs/ESMF_archdoc}.

\section{How to Submit Comments on the ESMF Design}
\label{sec:Submission}
Comments on the ESMF API and design may be submitted to the ESMF development 
using on-lines forms available from the {\bf Development} link on the ESMF 
website, \htmladdnormallink{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu}{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu}.  
The {\bf Development} 
link on the ESMF website also includes on-line forms for the submission of 
new requirements, if it seems that the current API does not satisfy the needs of 
your application.  We welcome input on any aspect of the ESMF project; general
questions and comments should be sent to \htmladdnormallink{esmf@ucar.edu}
{mailto:esmf@ucar.edu}.
