%\subsection{Use and Examples}

A typical sequence of tasks associated with using the Log utility would begin
with the user calling {\tt ESMF\_LogOpen()} to open a Log file and retrieve
an active Log object.  The user can then set or get options on how the Log
should be used with the {\tt ESMF\_LogSet()} and {\tt ESMF\_LogGet()} methods.
These are not fully implemented at this time. 

Depending on how the options are set, {\tt ESMF\_LogWrite()} either writes
user messages direstly to a Log file or writes to a buffer that can be flushed
when full or by using the {\tt ESMF\_LogFlush()} method.  In the current
implementation the Log flushes after every write.  When done writing
messages, the Log is closed by calling {\tt ESMF\_LogClose()}.  

Some of the assumptions implicit in using the Log utility are:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Prior to closing, {\tt ESMF\_LogFlush} is always executed.
\item Prior to halting, {\tt ESMF\_LogFlush} is always executed.
\item If the number of elements in a Log exceeds {\tt maxElements}, 
a message is written to file and the buffer flushes automatically.

\end{enumerate}
