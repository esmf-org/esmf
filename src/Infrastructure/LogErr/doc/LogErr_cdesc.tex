%\subsection{Description}
\label{sec:Log}

The Log class consists of a variety of methods for writing error, warning, and
informational messages to files.  A default Log is created at ESMF
initialization.

When ESMF is started with {\tt ESMC\_Initialize()}, multiple Log files will
be created by PET number.  The PET number (in the format
{\tt PETx.}) will be prepended to each file name where x is the PET number.
The {\tt ESMC\_LogWrite()} call is used to issue messages to the log.  As
part of the call, a message can be tagged as either an informational,
warning, or error message.

The messages may be buffered within ESMF before appearing in the log.
All messages will be properly flushed to the log files when {\tt ESMC\_Finalize()}
is called.
