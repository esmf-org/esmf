! \subsubsection{Create Array with automatic memory allocation}
!
! In the examples of the previous sections the user provided memory allocations
! for each of the DE-local regions for an Array object. The user was able to 
! use any of the Fortran methods to allocate memory, or go through
! the {\tt ESMF\_LocalArray} interfaces to obtain memory allocations before
! passing them into ArrayCreate(). Alternatively ESMF offers methods that 
! handle Array memory allocations inside the library.
! 
! As before, to create an {\tt ESMF\_Array} object an {\tt ESMF\_DistGrid}
! must be created. The DistGrid object holds information about the entire 
! index space and how it is decomposed into DE-local exclusive regions. The 
! following line of code creates a DistGrid for a 5x5 global index space that 
! is decomposed into 2 x 3 = 6 DEs.
!EOE
!BOC
  distgrid = ESMF_DistGridCreate(minIndex=(/1,1/), maxIndex=(/5,5/), &
    regDecomp=(/2,3/), rc=rc)
!EOC  
  if (rc /= ESMF_SUCCESS) call ESMF_Finalize(endflag=ESMF_END_ABORT)
!BOE
! The following is a representation of the index space and its decomposition into
! DEs. Each asterisk (*) represents a single element.

! Besides the DistGrid it is the {\em type, kind} and {\em rank} information,
! "tkr" for short, that is required to create an Array object. It turns out that
! the rank of the Array object is fully determined by the DistGrid and other 
! (optional) arguments passed into ArrayCreate(), so that explicit 
! specification of the Array rank is redundant.
!
! The simplest way to supply the type and kind information of the Array is
! directly through the {\tt typekind} argument. Here a double precision Array
! is created on the previously created DistGrid. Since no other arguments are
! specified that could alter the rank of the Array it becomes equal to the 
! dimCount of the DistGrid, i.e a 2D Array is created on top of the DistGrid.

!BOE
! Alternatively the same Array can be created specifying the "tkr" information
! in form of an ArraySpec variable. The ArraySpec explicitly contains the 
! Array rank and thus results in an over specification on the ArrayCreate()
! interface. ESMF checks all input information for consistency and returns 
! appropriate error codes in case any inconsistencies are found.

!BOE
! The Array object created by the above call is an ESMF distributed 
! object. As such it must follow the ESMF convention that requires that

!EOE

!BOE
! \subsubsection{Native language memory access}
! \label{Array_native_language_localde}
!
! There are two different methods by which the user can access the data held 
! inside an ESMF Array object. The first method provides direct access to a
! native language array object. Specifically, the {\tt farrayPtr} argument
! returned by {\tt ESMF\_ArrayGet()} is a Fortran array pointer that can be
! used to access the PET-local data inside the Array object.
!
! Many applications work in the 1 DE per PET mode, with exactly one DE on 
! every PET. Accessing the Array memory on each PET for this situation is 
! especially simple as is shown in section \ref{Array_from_native_1_to_1}.
! However, the Array class is not restricted to the special 1 DE per PET case,
! but supports multiple separate memory allocations on each PET.
! The number of such PET-local allocations is given by the {\tt localDeCount},
! i.e. there is one memory allocation for every DE that is associated with the
! local PET.
!
! Access to a specific local memory allocation of an Array object is still
! accomplished by returning the {\tt farrayPtr} argument. However, for
! $ localDeCount > 1 $ the formally optional {\tt localDe} argument to
! {\tt ESMF\_ArrayGet()} turns into a practically required argument. While
! in general the {\tt localDe} in ESMF is simply a local index variable that 
! enumerates the DEs that are associated with the local PET (e.g. see section
! \ref{DELayout_general_mapping}), the bounds of this index variable are 
! strictly defined as {\tt [0,...,localDeCount-1]} when it is used as an 
! input argument. The following code demonstrates this.
!
! First query the Array for {\tt localDeCount}. This number may be different
! on each PET and indicates how many DEs are mapped against the local PET.
!EOE
!BOC
  call ESMF_ArrayGet(array, localDeCount=localDeCount, rc=rc)
!EOC  
  if (rc /= ESMF_SUCCESS) call ESMF_Finalize(endflag=ESMF_END_ABORT)
!BOE
! Looping the {\tt localDe} index variable from 0 to {\tt localDeCount-1} allows
! access to each of the local memory allocations of the Array object:
!EOE
!BOC
  do localDe=0, localDeCount-1
    call ESMF_ArrayGet(array, farrayPtr=myFarray, localDe=localDe, rc=rc)
!EOC
    if (rc /= ESMF_SUCCESS) call ESMF_Finalize(endflag=ESMF_END_ABORT)
!BOC
    ! use myFarray to access local DE data
  enddo
!EOC
!
!BOE
! The second method to access the memory allocations in an Array object is to
! go through the ESMF LocalArray object. To this end the Array is queried
! for a list of PET-local LocalArray objects. The LocalArray objects in the list
! correspond to the DEs on the local PET. Here the {\tt localDe} argument is
! solely a user level index variable, and in principle the lower bound can be 
! chosen freely. However, for better alignment with the previous case (where 
! {\tt localDe} served as an input argument to an ESMF method) the following
! example again fixes the lower bound at zero.
!EOE
!BOC
  allocate(larrayList(0:localDeCount-1))
  call ESMF_ArrayGet(array, localarrayList=larrayList, rc=rc)
!EOC  
  if (rc /= ESMF_SUCCESS) call ESMF_Finalize(endflag=ESMF_END_ABORT)
!BOC
  do localDe=0, localDeCount-1
    call ESMF_LocalArrayGet(larrayList(localDe), myFarray, &
       datacopyflag=ESMF_DATACOPY_REFERENCE, rc=rc)
!EOC
    if (rc /= ESMF_SUCCESS) call ESMF_Finalize(endflag=ESMF_END_ABORT)
!BOC
    ! use myFarray to access local DE data
  enddo
!EOC
!BOE
! See section \ref{Array:LocalArray} for more on LocalArray usage in Array. 
! In most cases memory access through a LocalArray list is less convenient than
! the direct {\tt farrayPtr} method because it adds an extra object level 
! between the ESMF Array and the native language array.

!BOE
! \subsubsection{Regions and default bounds}
! \label{Array_regions_and_default_bounds}
!
! Each {\tt ESMF\_Array} object is decomposed into DEs as specified by the
! associated {\tt ESMF\_DistGrid} object. Each piece of this decomposition, i.e.
! each DE, holds a chunk of the Array data in its own local piece of memory.
! The details of the Array decomposition are described in the following 
! paragraphs.
!
! At the center of the Array decomposition is the {\tt ESMF\_DistGrid} class.
! The DistGrid object specified during Array creation contains three essential
! pieces of information:
! \begin{itemize}
! \item The extent and topology of the global domain covered by the Array object
!       in terms of indexed elements. The total extent may be a composition of
!       smaller logically rectangular (LR) domain pieces called tiles.
! \item The decomposition of the entire domain into "element exclusive" DE-local
!       LR chunks. {\em Element exclusive} means that there is no element overlap
!       between DE-local chunks. This, however, does not exclude degeneracies 
!       on edge boundaries for certain topologies (e.g. bipolar).
! \item The layout of DEs over the available PETs and thus the distribution of
!       the Array data.
! \end{itemize}
!
! Each element of an Array is associated with a {\em single} DE. The union of
! elements associated with a DE, as defined by the DistGrid above, corresponds
! to a LR chunk of index space, called the {\em exclusive region} of the DE.
!
! There is a hierarchy of four regions that can be identified for each DE in an
! Array object. Their definition and relationship to each other is as follows:
! \begin{itemize}
! \item {\em Interior Region}: Region that only contains local elements that are
!       {\em not} mapped into the halo of any other DE. The shape and size of 
!       this region for a particular DE depends non-locally on the halos defined
!       by other DEs and may change during computation as halo operations are
!       precomputed and released. Knowledge of the interior elements may be used
!       to improve performance by overlapping communications with ongoing 
!       computation for a DE.
! \item {\em Exclusive Region}: Elements for which a DE claims exclusive
!       ownership. Practically this means that the DE will be the sole source
!       for these elements in halo and reduce operations. There are exceptions
!       to this in some topologies. The exclusive region includes all elements
!       of the interior region.
! \item {\em Computational Region}: Region that can be set arbitrarily within
!       the bounds of the total region (defined next). The typical use of the
!       computation region is to define bounds that only include elements that
!       are updated by a DE-local computation kernel. The computational region
!       does not need to include all exclusive elements and it may also contain
!       elements that lie outside the exclusive region.
! \item {\em Total (Memory) Region}: Total of all DE-locally allocated elements.
!       The size and shape of the total memory region must accommodate the
!       union of exclusive and computational region but may contain 
!       additional elements. Elements outside the exclusive region may overlap
!       with the exclusive region of another DE which makes them potential 
!       receivers for Array halo operations. Elements outside the exclusive
!       region that do not overlap with the exclusive region of another DE
!       can be used to set boundary conditions and/or serve as extra memory 
!       padding.

!
! The {\em exclusive region} is determined during Array creation by the 
! DistGrid argument. Optional arguments may be used to specify the 
! {\em computational region} when the Array is created, by default it will be
! set equal to the exclusive region. The {\em total region}, i.e. the actual
! memory allocation for each DE, is also determined during Array creation. When
! creating the Array object from existing Fortran arrays the total region is
! set equal to the memory provided by the Fortran arrays. Otherwise the 
! default is to allocate as much memory as is needed to accommodate the union
! of the DE-local exclusive and computational region. Finally it is also
! possible to use optional arguments to the ArrayCreate() call to specify the
! total region of the object explicitly.
!
! The {\tt ESMF\_ArrayCreate()} call checks that the input parameters are
! consistent and will result in an Array that fulfills all of the above 
! mentioned requirements for its DE-local regions.
!
! Once an Array object has been created the exclusive and total regions are
! fixed. The computational region, however, may be adjusted within the limits
! of the total region using the {\tt ArraySet()} call.
!
! The {\em interior region} is very different from the other regions in that
! it cannot be specified. The {\em interior region} for each DE is a {\em
! consequence} of the choices made for the other regions collectively across
! all DEs into which an Array object is decomposed. An Array object can be
! queried for its DE-local {\em interior regions} as to offer additional
! information to the user necessary to write more efficient code.
! %See section 
! %\ref{ArrayEx_interiorRegion}(not yet implemented) for more details.
!
! By default the bounds of each DE-local {\em total region} are defined as

! \subsubsection{Array bounds}
!
! The loop over Array elements at the end of the last section only works
! correctly because of the default definition of the {\em computational} and
! {\em total regions} used in the example. In general, without such specific
! knowledge about an Array object, it is necessary to use a more formal approach
! to access its regions with DE-local indices.
!
! The DE-local {\em exclusive region} takes a central role in the definition
! of Array bounds. Even as the {\em computational region} may adjust during 
! the course of execution the {\em exclusive region} remains unchanged.
! The {\em exclusive region} provides a unique reference frame
! for the index space of all Arrays associated with the same DistGrid.
!
! There is a choice between two indexing options that needs to be made during 
! Array creation. By default each DE-local exclusive region starts at 
! {\tt (1, 1, ..., 1)}. However, for some computational kernels it may be more
! convenient to choose the index bounds of the DE-local exclusive regions to 
! match the index space coordinates as they are defined in the corresponding
! DistGrid object. The second option is only available if the DistGrid object 
! does not contain any non-contiguous decompositions (such as cyclically
! decomposed dimensions).
!
! The following example code demonstrates the safe way of dereferencing the
! DE-local exclusive regions of the previously created {\tt array} object.
!

! Obviously the second branch of this simple code will work for either case,

! The advantage of the {\tt ESMF\_INDEX\_GLOBAL} index option is that

! In the previous examples the computational region of {\tt array} was chosen 
! by default to be identical to the exclusive region defined by the DistGrid

! The index space topology of this example is very simple. The DistGrid is
! defined by a single LR tile and does not contain any extra connections.
! Consequently,
! DEs that are located at the edge of the index space may contain DE-local 
! computational and total regions that reach beyond the index space as it is
! defined by 
! the DistGrid. For example DE 1's computational and total region, as shown 
! in the diagram above, contain extra elements that are not covered by the
! index space described by the DistGrid object. 
!
! The situation is different for interior DEs, or when the widths specified
! during Array creation are asymmetric. For the current example DE 3, for
! instance,
! only contains elements in its total and computational region that lie within
! the DistGrid index space. Elements in the total region that are outside of a 
! DE's exclusive region are then redundant with another DE's exclusive elements. 
! Redundancies in the computational region may be enforced or monitored by
! special Array communication calls. Total region elements that are outside the 
! computational region may be part of a halo operation and may be updated with 
! the value of the corresponding exclusive element in another DE using halo 
! communication methods.
!
! Computational elements that are outside the DistGrid index space are kept for 
! convenience, simplifying the formulation of the computational kernel. 
! Naturally, redundancy cannot be checked or enforced for these elements. 
! Similarly, halo elements that do not correspond to elements within the index space
! of the DistGrid will not be updated during halo communications. It is up to
! the application writer to utilize the provided elements as is appropriate for the
! computational algorithm. The Array class offers mask type information 
! through the {\tt ESMF\_ArrayGet()} method in order to assist the user in 
! dealing with elements that are not part of the Array index space as it is 
! defined in the corresponding DistGrid object.

! \subsubsection{Interior region and Array's total element mask}
! \label{ArrayEx_interiorRegion}
!
! The {\em Array total element mask} is a native Fortran integer array of
! the same rank as the ESMF Array object. The array must be allocated and 
! deallocated by the user and is filled by the ArrayGet() method with the
! mask information. (The Array object does not store the mask information
! internally (to save memory) but generates the information on the fly when
! inquired.)
!
! The array variable used as mask argument must be allocated to 
! accommodate the total region for the inquired DE. The bounds must
! be chosen to match the totalLBound(:) and totalUBound(:) parameters of the
! Array.
!
! For the {\tt array} object created in the previous section the total element mask
! for DE 1 would need to be allocated as
!EOEI
!BOCI
  allocate(totalElementMask(3:8, -3:3))              ! rank=2
!EOCI
!BOEI
! Then, assuming that DE 1 was localDE 1 on the PET issuing the following
! call the mask can be obtained in the following manner.
!EOEI
!BOCI
  call ESMF_ArrayGet(array, localDe=1, totalElementMask=totalElementMask, rc=rc)
!EOCI
!BOEI
! Now the {\tt totalElementMask} variable contains the mask for the total
! region for DE 1 for {\tt array}. For the example the mask will contain the
! following values:

! have elements in their total region that correspond to this DE's exclusive element.
! A value of "-3" for an exclusive element indicates that there exists a redundancy
! with another DE's exclusive region and a value of "-4" indicates redundancy 
! and dependency between DEs. Finally, a element value of "-1" in the exclusive
! region indicates that there are no other DEs in the Array that depend on this
! exclusive element. The union of exclusive elements with mask value "-1" define the 
! {\em absolute interior region} of the DE. In this example DE 1 does not 
! contain any absolute interior elements.
!
! The next larger rectangle in the above diagram corresponds to the 
! computational region of DE 1 and the entire array extent is that of this DE's
! total region. A element mask value of "-1" in these regions indicates that 
! there are no elements in any of the DEs' exclusive regions that corresponds to 
! this element, i.e. the element lies outside the index space covered by DistGrid.
!
! Mask values $>= 0$ in the computational and total regions indicate the DE 
! which contains the corresponding element in its exclusive region. Thus a element 
! with mask value $>= 0$ lies within the DistGrid index space.

! the Array halo operations used in the previous section.

! input parameter is defined as a list of RouteHandles.

! \subsubsection{Arrays with undistributed dimensions}
! \label{sec:array:usage:undistributed_dims}
!
! Except for the special Array create interface that implements a copy from
! an existing Array object all other Array create interfaces require the 
! specification of at least two arguments: {\tt farray} and {\tt distgrid},
! {\tt larrayList} and {\tt distgrid}, or {\tt arrayspec} and {\tt distgrid}.
! In all these cases both required arguments contain a sense of dimensionality.
! The relationship between these two arguments deserves extra attention.
!
! The first argument, {\tt farray}, {\tt larrayList} or {\tt arrayspec}, 
! determines the rank of the created Array object, i.e. the dimensionality
! of the actual data storage. The rank of a native language array, extracted 
! from an Array object, is equal to the rank specified by either of these
! arguments. So is the {\tt rank} that is returned by the {\tt ESMF\_ArrayGet()}
! call.
!
! The rank specification contained in the {\tt distgrid} argument, which is of 
! type {\tt ESMF\_DistGrid}, on the other hand has no effect on the
! rank of the Array. The {\tt dimCount} specified by the DistGrid object,
! which may be equal, greater or less than the Array rank, determines the 
! dimensionality of the {\em decomposition}.
!
! While there is no constraint between DistGrid {\tt dimCount} and Array
! {\tt rank}, there is an important relationship between the two, resulting in
! the concept of index space dimensionality. Array dimensions can be
! arbitrarily mapped against DistGrid dimension, rendering them {\em decomposed}
! dimensions. The index space dimensionality is equal to the number of 
! decomposed Array dimensions.
!
! \begin{sloppypar}
! Array dimensions that are not mapped to DistGrid dimensions are the 
! {\em undistributed} dimensions of the Array. They are not part
! of the index space. The mapping is specified during {\tt ESMF\_ArrayCreate()}
! via the {\tt distgridToArrayMap} argument. DistGrid dimensions that have
! not been associated with Array dimensions are {\em replicating} dimensions.
! The Array will be replicated across the DEs that lie along replication
! DistGrid dimensions.
! \end{sloppypar}
!
! Undistributed Array dimensions can be used to store multi-dimensional data for
! each Array index space element. One application of this is to store the 
! components of a vector quantity in a single Array. The same 2D {\tt distgrid}
! object as before will be used.

! of code reproduce the above example but with rearranged dimensions. Here the
! {\tt distgridToArrayMap} argument is a list with two elements corresponding to
! the DistGrid {\tt dimCount} of 2. The first element indicates which Array
! dimension the first DistGrid dimension is mapped against. Here the
! 1st DistGrid dimension maps against the 3rd Array dimension and the 2nd 
! DistGrid dimension maps against the 1st Array dimension. This leaves the 2nd

! DistGrid {\tt dimCount}, because the maximum number of distributed Array
! dimensions is given by the dimensionality of the index space.

! \subsubsection{Arrays with replicated dimensions}
! \label{sec:array:usage:replicated_dims}
!
! Thus far most examples demonstrated cases where the DistGrid {\tt dimCount}
! was equal to the Array {\tt rank}. The previous section introduced the
! concept of Array {\em tensor} dimensions when {\tt dimCount < rank}. In this
! section {\tt dimCount} and {\tt rank} are assumed completely unconstrained and
! the relationship to {\tt distgridToArrayMap} and {\tt arrayToDistGridMap} will
! be discussed.
!
! The Array class allows completely arbitrary mapping between Array and
! DistGrid dimensions. Most cases considered in the previous sections used
! the default mapping which assigns the DistGrid dimensions in sequence to the
! lower Array dimensions. Extra Array dimensions, if present, are considered
! non-distributed tensor dimensions for which the optional {\tt undistLBound}
! and {\tt undistUBound} arguments must be specified.
!
! The optional {\tt distgridToArrayMap} argument provides the option to override
! the default DistGrid to Array dimension mapping. The entries of the
! {\tt distgridToArrayMap} array correspond to the DistGrid dimensions in
! sequence and assign a unique Array dimension to each DistGrid dimension.
! DistGrid and Array dimensions are indexed starting at {\tt 1} for the lowest
! dimension. A value of {\tt "0"} in the {\tt distgridToArrayMap} array 
! indicates that the respective DistGrid dimension is {\em not} mapped against
! any Array dimension. What this means is that the Array will be replicated 
! along this DistGrid dimension.

! communicated and replicated between different DEs, but it means that different

! \subsubsection{Shared memory features: DE pinning, sharing, and migration}
! \label{Array_shared_memory_features}
!
! Practically all modern computer systems today utilize multi-core processors,
! supporting the concurrent execution of multiple hardware threads.
! A number of these multi-core processors are commonly packaged into the same
! compute node, having access to the same physical memory. Under ESMF each
! hardware thread (or core) is identified as a unique Processing Element (PE).
! The collection of PEs that share the same physical memory (i.e. compute node)
! is referred to as a Single System Image (SSI). The ESMF Array class implements
! features that allow the user to leverage the shared memory within each SSI to
! efficiently exchange data without copies or explicit communication calls.
!
! The software threads executing an ESMF application on the hardware, and that
! ESMF is aware of, are referred to as Persistent Execution Threads (PETs). In
! practice a PET can typically be thought of as an MPI rank, i.e. an OS process,
! defining its own private virtual address space (VAS). 
! The ESMF Virtual Machine (VM) class keeps track of the mapping between PETs
! and PEs, and their location on the available SSIs.
!
! When an ESMF Array object is created, the specified DistGrid indicates how
! many Decomposition Elements (DEs) are created. Each DE has its own memory
! allocation to hold user data. The DELayout, referenced by the DistGrid,
! determines which PET is considered the {\em owner} of each of the DEs. Queried
! for the local DEs, the Array object returns the list of DEs that are owned by
! the local PET making the query.
!
! By default DEs are {\em pinned} to the PETs under which they were created.
! The memory allocation associated with a specific DE is only defined in the
! VAS of the PET to which the DE is pinned. As a consequence, only the PET
! owning a DE has access to its memory allocation.
!
! On shared memory systems, however, ESMF allows DEs to be pinned to SSIs
! instead of PETs. In this case the PET under which a DE was created is still
! consider the owner, but now {\em all} PETs under the same SSI have access to
! the DE. For this the memory allocation associated with the DE is mapped into
! the VAS of all the PETs under the SSI.
!
! To create an Array with each DE pinned to SSI instead of PET, first query the
! VM for the available level of support.

! Just as in the cases discussed before, where the same DistGrid was used, a

! the {\tt pinflag} to {\tt ESMF\_PIN\_DE\_TO\_SSI} does not change the
! fact that each PET owns exactly one of the DEs. However, assuming that this
! code is run on a set of PETs that are all located under the same SSI, every
! PET now has {\em access} to all of the DEs. The situation can be observed by
! querying for both the {\tt localDeCount}, and the {\tt ssiLocalDeCount}.

! index is provided through the {\tt localDeToDeMap} array argument. The amount
! of mapping information returned is dependent on how large {\tt localDeToDeMap}
! has been sized by the user. For {\tt size(localDeToDeMap)==localDeCount},
! only mapping information for those DEs {\em owned} by the local PET is filled
! in. However for {\tt size(localDeToDeMap)==ssiLocalDeCount}, mapping
! information for all locally {\em accessible} DEs is returned, including

!BOE
! The first {\tt localDeCount} entries of {\tt localDeToDeMap} are always the

! DEs {\em shared} by other PETs. The ordering of the shared DEs is from
! smallest to greatest, excluding the locally owned DEs, which were already
! listed at the beginning of {\tt localDeToDeMap}. For the current case, again
! assuming execution on 4 PETs all located on the same SSI, we expect the
! following situation:
!
! PET 0: {\tt localDeToDeMap}=={\tt(/0,1,2,3/)}\newline
! PET 1: {\tt localDeToDeMap}=={\tt(/1,0,2,3/)}\newline
! PET 2: {\tt localDeToDeMap}=={\tt(/2,0,1,3/)}\newline
! PET 3: {\tt localDeToDeMap}=={\tt(/3,0,1,2/)}\newline
!
! Each PET can access the memory allocations associated with {\em all} of the
! DEs listed in the {\tt localDeToDeMap} returned by the Array object. Direct
! access to the Fortran array pointer of a specific memory allocation is
! available through {\tt ESMF\_ArrayGet()}. Here each PET queries for the
! {\tt farrayPtr} of {\tt localDe==2}, i.e. the 2nd shared DE.

!BOE
! Now variable {\tt myFarray} on PETs 0 and 1 both point to the {\em same}
! memory allocation for global DE 2. Both PETs have access to the same
! piece of shared memory! The same is true for PETs 2 and 3, pointing to the
! shared memory allocation of global DE 1.

! It is important to note that all of the typical considerations surrounding
! shared memory programming apply when accessing shared DEs! Proper
! synchronization between PETs accessing shared DEs is critical to avoid
! {\em race conditions}. Also performance issues like {\em false sharing}
! need to be considered for optimal use.

!EOC

!BOE
! Working with shared DEs requires additional bookkeeping on the user code
! level. In some situations, however, DE sharing is simply used as a mechanism
! to {\em move} DEs between PETs without requiring data copies. One practical
! application of this case is the transfer of an Array between two components,
! both of which use the same PEs, but run with different number of PETs.
! These would typically be sequential components that use OpenMP on the user
! level with varying threading levels.
!
! DEs that are pinned to SSI can be moved or {\em migrated} to any PET within
! the SSI. This is accomplished by creating a new Array object from an
! existing Array that was created with {\tt pinflag=ESMF\_PIN\_DE\_TO\_SSI}.
! The information of how the DEs are to migrate between the old and the new
! Array is provided through a DELayout object. This object must have the
! same number of DEs and describes how they map to the PETs on the current VM.
! If this is in the context of a different component, the number of PETs might
! differ from the original VM under which the existing Array was created. This
! situation is explicitly supported, still the number of DEs must match.
!
! Here a simple DELayout is created on the same 4 PETs, but with rotated
! DE ownerships:
!
! DE 0 -> PET 1 (old PET 0)\newline
! DE 1 -> PET 2 (old PET 1)\newline
! DE 2 -> PET 3 (old PET 2)\newline
