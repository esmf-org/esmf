%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\bf Limited types of trace events.}
  Currently only a few trace event types are available. The tracer may
  be extended in the future to record additional types of events.
\item{\bf MPI call profing not available for statically linked executables on Darwin.}
  Currently the linker on Darwin systems does not support the wrapping of
  symbols during static linking. In order to access MPI call profiling on Darwin,
  executables should be linked dynamically in combination with the procedure
  described in section \ref{sec:MPIProfiling}.
\end{enumerate}
