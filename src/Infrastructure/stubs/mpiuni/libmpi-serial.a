This is a dummy file needed to satisfy PIO's FindMPISERIAL.cmake.

This is needed because, when building with mpiuni, we tell PIO that this
mpiuni directory is the location of mpi-serial (since we use mpiuni for
the same purpose as mpi-serial). But for FindMPISERIAL.cmake to succeed,
it needs to find a libmpi-serial.a in the mpi-serial directory; hence,
we put this file here to trick it into thinking that this is truly an
mpi-serial installation.
