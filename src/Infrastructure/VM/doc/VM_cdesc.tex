The ESMF VM (Virtual Machine) class is a generic representation of hardware and system software resources. There is exactly one VM object per ESMF Component, providing the execution environment for the Component code. The VM class handles all resource management tasks for the Component class and provides a description of the underlying configuration of the compute resources used by a Component.

In addition to resource description and management, the VM class offers the lowest level of ESMF communication methods. The VM communication calls are very similar to MPI. Data references in VM communication calls must be provided as raw, language-specific, one-dimensional, contiguous data arrays. The similarity between VM and MPI communication calls is striking and there are many equivalent point-to-point and collective communication calls. However, unlike MPI, the VM communication calls support communication between threaded PETs in a completely transparent fashion.

Many ESMF applications do not interact with the VM class directly very much. The  resource management aspect is wrapped completely transparent into the ESMF Component concept. Often the only reason that user code queries a Component
object for the associated VM object is to inquire about resource information, such as the {\tt localPet} or the {\tt petCount}. Further, for most applications the use of higher level communication APIs, such as provided by Array and Field, are much more convenient than using the low level VM communication calls.

The basic elements of a VM are called PETs, which stands for Persistent Execution Threads. These are equivalent to OS threads with a lifetime of at least that of the associated component. All VM functionality is expressed in terms of PETs. In the simplest, and most common case, a PET is equivalent to an MPI process. However, ESMF also supports multi-threading, where multiple PETs run as Pthreads inside the same virtual address space (VAS).
