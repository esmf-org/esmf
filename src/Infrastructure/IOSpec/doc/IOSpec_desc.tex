The IOSpec in a simple class that specifies the options for 
an IO activity.  An important choice is the IO format.  Currently
only netCDF is supported.  Other options include 
whether IO should be written to a single file or multiple files, 
the Fortran unit number, and the filename.  The IO activity can
be identified as being a restart write {\tt ESMF\_IO\_RESTART} or 
a history write {\tt ESMF\_IO\_HISTORY}, if desired.
