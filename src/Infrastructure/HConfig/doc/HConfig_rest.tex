%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item The YAML Core schema, which is an extension of the JSON schema, is
  implemented and used to resolve non-specific tags under HConfig.
  There is currently no mechanism implemented to switch to a different schema
  for tag resolution.
\item Currently the only available removal method for HConfig {\em map}
  objects requires that {\em keys} be simple scalar strings.
\item There is currently no method implemented that allows setting of tags from
  from the API.
\end{itemize}
