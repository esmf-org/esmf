\subsubsection{ESMF\_HCONFIGMATCH}
\label{const:hconfigmatch}

{\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}
Indicates the level to which two HConfig variables match.

The type of this flag is:

{\tt type(ESMF\_HConfigMatch\_Flag)}

The valid values in ascending order are:
\begin{description}
\item [ESMF\_HCONFIGMATCH\_INVALID:] Indicates a non-valid matching level. One
  or both HConfig objects are invalid.
\item [ESMF\_HCONFIGMATCH\_NONE:] The lowest valid level of HConfig matching.
  This indicates that the HConfig objects are valid, but their YAML
  representation does not match.
\item [ESMF\_HCONFIGMATCH\_EXACT:] There is an exact match between the YAML
  representation of both HConfig objects. They may or may not be aliases to
  the same object in memory.
\item [ESMF\_HCONFIGMATCH\_ALIAS:] Both HConfig variables are aliases to the
  exact same HConfig object in memory.
\end{description}
