\req{Physical locations}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A mechanism shall be provided for describing physical locations in space in 1,
2, or 3 dimensions, including both specification of points and of ranges.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by CAM-EUL, CLM, CCSM-CPL, POP, CICE, 
              CAM-FV, PSAS, MIT, WRF, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} System test.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Horizontal locations}

\ssreq{Horizontal coordinates}

Physical domains may use Cartesian, spherical, or cylindrical coordinate
systems in the horizontal directions.  Units for these coordinates are meters
(for Cartesian), degrees of latitude and longitude (for spherical), and meters
and degrees for the radius and angle in cylindrical coordinates.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by CAM-EUL, CLM, CCSM-CPL, POP, CICE, NCEP-GSM, NCEP-SSI, CAM-FV, PSAS, MIT, GFDL \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Code inspection.\\
{\bf Notes:}  This suggestion follows common practice, but is an explicit
exception to the requirement that MKS units are used by ESMF codes wherever
units must be assumed. 
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Horizontal locations may be points}

Horizontal locations may be specified as a pair of real values in the order
(X,Y) or (longitude, latitude).
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by POP, CICE, Regrid, NCEP-GSM, NCEP-SSI,
              PSAS, MIT, WRF, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.
\end{reqlist}


\ssreq{Horizontal locations may be polygonal regions}

  Horizontal locations may be specified to be regions by providing the number
of vertices and the list of the vertex points.  Vertex points must be specified
either clockwise or counterclockwise around the region.  The vertex points
may be redundant.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by POP, CICE, Regrid, PSAS, MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.\\
{\bf Notes:} Fundamental to allowing conservative interpolation, and for a
precise description of data locations.
\end{reqlist}
 
\ssreq{Horizontal regions may have central points}

  Both a central point and a region may be specified in describing a horizontal
location.  The points may provide a convenient nominal location, even when
a value actually pertains to a region.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by POP, CICE, Regrid, PSAS, MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.\\
{\bf Notes:} Many models mix finite difference and finite volume concepts.
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Horizontal regions may be circular}

  A horizontal location may be specified by adding a nominal radius of
influence to the central point.  This may be the radius of a Gaussian
distribution of influence. The exact interpretation of this radius is
the responsibility of user-provided software.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by PSAS, MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-2. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.\\
{\bf Notes:} This is necessary for describing certain observational data streams.
\end{reqlist}


\ssreq{Paths between grid locations may be specified} 

A method for determining the path connecting grid locations 
is required.  This path would be used to accurately compute
intersections for Regridding, lengths of cell sides, grid
cell areas and a variety of other grid metrics.  A linear 
approximation between points is a proper assumption for 
cartesian grids and for computing sides of latitude/longitude
or reduced grid cells.  A linear approximation is also 
adequate in many other cases and would be a logical default choice. 
The most accurate solution would permit users to pass a 
subroutine which provides analytic or highly-accurate discrete 
forms of the grid Jacobian (the matrix of partial derivatives of 
the physical coordinates with respect to logical coordinates).  An 
additional possibility might internally support analytic forms like 
great circles or higher-order approximations (eg quadratic
approximation to the cell side given a midpoint in addition
to the two endpoints).

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Regrid, required by codes that use conservative interpolation. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.\\
{\bf Notes:} Necessary for allowing conservative interpolation.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Vertical locations}

\ssreq{Vertical coordinates}

Physical domains may use a variety of vertical coordinates, including pressure,
height, density, isotherms, sigma, other terrain-following, or any other
vertically monotonic quantity.  In addition, a user-interpretable vertical
proxy (such as a satellite measurement channel) may be used.  Units of this
coordinate must be self-consistent.  (See the CF convention for a full
discussion of options for vertical coordinates at
http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/netcdf/CF-20010629.htm)
\begin{reqlist}

              CAM-FV, PSAS, MIT, WRF, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Vertical locations may be regions}

Vertical locations may be specified by providing the values of the top and
bottom bounding points.  Such regions have the same extent regardless of the
order in which the bounding points are specified.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by POP, MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Vertical regions have central points}

  Both a central point and a region may be specified in describing a vertical
location.  The points may provide a convenient nominal location, even when
a value actually pertains to a region.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by POP, NCEP-GSM, PSAS, MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.\\
{\bf Notes:} Many models mix finite difference and finite volume concepts.
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Vertical locations may have region of influence}

  A vertical location may be specified by adding a nominal radius of
influence to the central point.  This may be the radius of a Gaussian
distribution of influence. The exact interpretation of this radius is
the responsibility of user-provided software.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 3. \\
{\bf Source:} \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.\\
{\bf Notes:} This appears superfluous. It is more than enough to specify a range 
in 1D - Arlindo.
\end{reqlist}
 
\ssreq{Vertical locations may include lopped cells}

  Vertical locations may include a region whose bounds vary between the
horizontal corners of a region.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by MIT, NSIPP, POP, GFDL/MOM. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.\\
{\bf Note:} MOVE TO LATER - CNH
\end{reqlist}

%===============================================================================
\req{Location streams}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Streams of locations are used to describe the physical (and potentially temporal)
locations associated with streams of data.  Streams of locations differ from
physical grids (see below) in that there are no concept of neighboring values,
topology, covering a space, or of locations being exclusive.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by NCEP-SSI, PSAS, MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-2. \\
{\bf Verification:} System test.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Location streams may be created}
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} NCEP-SSI, PSAS, MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-2. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} 
\end{reqlist}

{\bf Status:} Approved-2. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} 
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Location streams may be copied}
Given an existing location stream, a new stream may be generated with a and
possibly a different length.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2. \\
{\bf Source:} PSAS, MIT, GFDL.\\
{\bf Status:} Approved-2. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Reading streams}
Location streams may be read from files.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by NCEP-SSI, MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} I no longer find this necessary. It is sufficient to have an IO requirement for fields (which can be defined on location streams) - Arlindo. - ditto CNH (but it is a requirement!).
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Writing streams}
Location streams may be written to files.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required NCEP-SSI, MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} See previous - Arlindo.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Background grid}
A location stream may have associated with it an underlying physical grid, so that each
location stream element may be uniquely associated with a single grid cell. (A single
grid cell may contain multiple location stream elements.)
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by NCEP-SSI, PSAS, MIT, GFDL \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} This is necessary for such operations as halo updates on a location
stream. A background grid might be required because its hard to see how to
decompose the locations tream otherwise.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Location stream attributes}

\ssreq{Fixed length location streams}
Location streams may be of fixed length, specified at the time of generation.
\begin{reqlist}

{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. 
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Extensible length location streams}
Location streams may be of extensible length
with an initial length specified at the time of generation.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} \\
{\bf Source:} \\
{\bf Status:} Deferred \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.\\
{\bf Notes:} Are we sure we want to reject? Could they just be
not as optimised. Imagine a location stream that is representing Lagrangian
elements in a decomposed fluid simulation. It could be useful to
be able to add particles as needed. It could be useful to delete
from middle etc...
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Global attributes: location stream name}
Each location stream has a unique name by which it can be referred.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} \\
{\bf Source:} \\
{\bf Status:} Rejected. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:}
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Location stream registry}
Upon creation, the name and a pointer to each location stream shall be stored in a
registry.  A pointer to any location stream may be determined given its name.

{\bf Source:} \\
{\bf Status:} Rejected. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Not part of PhysGrid
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Global attributes: number of dimensions}
A location stream may be queried for the number of dimensions, which is
set at the time of creation of the stream.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by PSAS, MIT, GFDL.\\
{\bf Status:} Approved-2. \\
{\bf Verification:} Code inspection.
{\bf Note:} REJECT because of Arlindo {Elements in stream have similar properties}
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Global attributes: dimension names}
Each dimension has a name, which may be set and queried.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2. \\

A location stream contains the units of each dimension, which may be set and queried.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by PSAS, MIT, GFDL.\\
{\bf Status:} Approved-2. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Global attributes: text or numeric attributes}

A location stream may have an arbitrary number of text or numeric attributes,
which may be added, set and queried.  Each attribute has a text name by which it
can be queried.  Also, a location stream can be queried for a list of all global
attribute names.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by NCEP-SSI, MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-2. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Not quite sure what this is. Again, since we can define fields on location streams, not sure we need this here - Arlindo - ditto CNH (but it is a requirement!).
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Global attributes: number of elements and number in use}
The number of elements in a location stream is available.  For a fixed length stream,
both the total number of elements and the number of elements before the last
active element location may be queried.

{\bf Source:} Required by NCEP-SSI, PSAS, MIT, GFDL.\\
{\bf Status:} Approved-2. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. 
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Global attributes: null element location value}
Each location stream may indicate whether a particular location is active.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} \\
{\bf Source:} \\
{\bf Status:} Rejected. \\
{\bf Verification:} Code inspection. \\
{\bf Notes:} This functionality may be obtained with user-defined element
attributes, but this use will not be explicitly supported by ESMF.
\end{reqlist}


\ssreq{Elements in stream have similar properties}
All elements in a location stream will have the same numbers of dimensions, use the
same physical coordinates, the same units, the same element attributes (attributes at
some locations may be missing).
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2. \\
{\bf Source:} MIT. \\
{\bf Status:} Rejected. \\
{\bf Verification:} Code inspection. \\
{\bf Notes:} MAJOR OBJECTION. Where did this come from? I'd like to be able to represent the whole observation vector for a given synoptic time on a single location stream. While data have horizontal coordinates in (lat,lon), vertical coordinates may vary widely (winds at 10m above sfc, temperature at 500 hPa, to name a few). So, each element would contain the (lat,lon,lev,levunits); it is conceivable that at  some point one would need (lat,lon,lev,xunits,yunits,zunits) - Arlindo.

Text or data attributes may be attached to each element.  These
attributes may be null for any particular element.  Methods shall be provided to set
and query each element's attribute.  Element attributes may use standard names to
promote interoperability.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 3\\
{\bf Source:} \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} I don't see the point of this as one can define fields on location streams - Arlindo.
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Location streams may contain null (discarded) elements}

Some elements within a location stream may be set to be invalid.  This may be a way
to specify the elements that are irrelevant for a particular subdomain.

location stream.  This is necessary for location streams and data streams to be
manipulated in compatible ways.
\begin{reqlist}

\req{Physical grids}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A physical grid identifies a set of locations in physical space.  
Local physical grids provide the locations of each of the cells/points
associated with the range of indices in a distributed grid.  A local physical grid is
associated with a single distributed grid.  It may have undistributed dimensions that 
are not present in the underlying distributed grid. Multiple local 
physical grids may be derived from the same global, undistributed physical grid. 

Physical grids may be purely horizontal (one dimensional or two dimensional), purely vertical, or 3-dimensional. 
Structured grids assume that adjacent locations in index space share boundaries
in a predictable way.  Unstructured grids also have concepts of neighboring
cells, but the relative indices of neighbors are unpredictable.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by CAM-EUL, CLM, CCSM-CPL, POP, CICE, NCEP-GSM, NCEP-SSI,
     CAM-FV, PSAS, MIT, WRF, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} System test.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Reading grids}
Given a distributed grid, a local physical grid can be read from a standard file containing a
global physical grid. If no distributed grid is provided, the global physical grid will
be read in.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by CAM-EUL, CLM, CCSM-CPL, POP, CICE, 
              CAM-FV, PSAS, MIT, GFDL. \\

              CAM-FV, PSAS, MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.\\
{\bf Notes:}  Here a standard file means that the file will
be suitable for holding global physical grid, independent of distribution.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Local physical grids may be internally generated}
For an arbitrary number of points in the global domain of the associated
distributed grid, it may be possible to specify an algorithm for internally
determining the local physical grid.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by POP, CICE, NCEP-GSM, NCEP-SSI,
              CAM-FV, PSAS, MIT, WRF, GFDL. \\

{\bf Verification:} Unit test.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Null physical grid creation}
It shall be possible to create any data objects associated with a physical grid without
providing the data that a physical grid will contain.
\begin{reqlist}

\sreq{Physical grid query.}
Methods shall be provided to query a physical grid for all information it contains.

\sreq{Cell specification}
Physical grids shall specify both the locations of cell vertices, and the locations
of cell centers.

{\bf Source:} Required by POP, CICE, Regrid, NCEP-GSM, MIT, WRF, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.\\
{\bf Notes:} Many models mix finite difference and finite volume concepts.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Refinement}
A physical grid may be interpolated to generate a physical grid with an equivalent span
 at finer or coarser resolution.  Methods should be provided to accomplish such
interpolation via a simple interface that uses the Regrid facility.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by MIT(handled by regrid), GFDL(handled by regrid) \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.\\
{\bf Notes:} Necessary for runtime configurable resolution.  Also, note that 
there may be a Catch-22 here, as Regrid would naturally provide the facility
for Regridding, but Regrid will typically require the target physical grid for
creating the Regridding.  This requirement is also explicitly addressed within the
Regrid requirement document.

** NEED TO CHECK THE INDEX SPACE REGRIDDING *** \\

** NEED A SPCIFICATION FOR HOW TO MAP BETWEEN TWO COMPATIBLE GRIDS SO THAT \\
** REGRID CAN FIGURE OUT ALIGNMENT BETWEEN TWO SPHERICAL POLAR GRIDS OR \\
** BETWEEN CARTESIAN AND CYLINDRICAL. MAYBE THE NOTION OF A "COMMON POINT" \\
** THAT COULD REPRESENT THE SAME LOCATION IN SPACE. \\
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Regeneration}
A new local physical grid may be generated for a given distributed grid from another 
physical grid.
The span of the source physical grid may be the same as or a superset of
the span of the target.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2. \\
{\bf Source:} MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-2. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.\\
{\bf Notes:} Necessary for support of transposes, or of moving nests.

\sreq{Distributed grid reference}
A local physical grid may be queried for the distributed grid upon which it is based.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2. \\
{\bf Source:}  MIT, GFDL.\\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. 
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Horizontal coordinate independent of vertical}
Horizontal physical grid locations can be assumed independent of the vertical coordinate.
The horizontal metrics, however, may be function of the vertical coordinate, as
in thick-shell spherical coordinates.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Any Objections? \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Code inspection.\\
{\bf Notes:} If this assumption can be made, it greatly simplifies implementation.
No widely used counterexamples are known. This is a negative
requirement, i.e. something we are not going to do, there are no feaatures
required to support this.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Vertical coordinate potentially dependent on horizontal.}
Vertical physical grid locations may be functions of the horizontal coordinates, or may be
independent of them.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} GFDL-MOM4 (required), NSIPP, POP, 
              CAM-FV, PSAS, MIT, GFDL \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Code inspection.\\
{\bf Notes:} This is necessary to support, for example, partial cells in
Z-coordinate ocean models.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Dimension extension}
A new physical grid may be generated by adding a dimension to an existing 
physical grid.  The span of the source physical grid may be the same as or a superset of
the span of the target.  For a local physical grid, the new dimension will be independent 
of the underlying distributed grid, and both local physical grids share the same 
distributed grid.  The new dimension may be in any order with respect to existing dimensions.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2 \\
{\bf Source:} CCSM-CPL, GFDL, MIT \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1 \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test\\
{\bf Notes:} Valuable for separating generation of vertical and horizontal
coordinates.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Dimension reduction}
A new physical grid may be generated by removing a dimension from an existing physical grid.
For a local physical grid, if the dimension that is removed is one that is present 
in the original underlying distributed grid, an appropriately reduced distributed 
grid must also be provided.  Otherwise the new local physical
grid is based on the same distributed grid as the original physical grid.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2 \\
{\bf Source:} CCSM-CPL, GFDL, MIT \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-1 \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test\\
{\bf Notes:} This and {\it Dimension extension} have been made
Approved-1 beacuse the feature could be hard to add later.

\sreq{Arbitrary dimensional physical grids}
Physical grids may have an arbitrary number of dimensions. 
\begin{reqlist}

the topology information is so widely used in distributed grids, and since distributed grids
are used to initiate local physical grids, it is perhaps reasonable to make topology a
property of a distributed grid, which is then inherited and checked by a local physical grid.
