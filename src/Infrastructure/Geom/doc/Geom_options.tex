 This type is used to indicate the level to which two grids match.

The type of this flag is:

{\tt type(ESMF\_GridMatch\_Flag)}

The valid values are:
\begin{description}
\item [ESMF\_GRIDMATCH\_INVALID:] Indicates a non-valid matching level. Returned
      if an error occurs in the matching function. If a higher matching level
      is returned then no error occurred.
\item [ESMF\_GRIDMATCH\_NONE:] The lowest level of grid matching. 
      This indicates that the Grid's don't match at any of the higher levels. 
\item [ESMF\_GRIDMATCH\_EXACT:] All the pieces of the Grid (e.g. distgrids, 
      coordinates, etc.) except the name, match between the two Grids. 
\item [ESMF\_GRIDMATCH\_ALIAS:] Both Grid variables are aliases to the exact
      same Grid object in memory.
