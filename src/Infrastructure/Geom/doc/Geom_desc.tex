The ESMF Geom class is used as a generic holder for other ESMF geometry objects (e.g. an ESMF_Grid). This allows a generic
representation of a geometry to be passed through a couple system. Some operations (e.g. creating a Field) are supported on
a Geom object and more will be added over time as needed. However, if an unsupported operation is needed the specific object
can always be pulled out and operated on that way.
