%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\bf No mathematical operators.}
The Bundle class does not support differential or other
mathematical operators.

\item{\bf Limited collective field operations.}
The Bundle class does not automatically support collective field 
operations, other than a limited set including I/O, regridding, and 
indexing.  For other operations on Fields, first query the Bundle 
for the specific Field desired, then operate on it with Field methods.

\end{enumerate}
