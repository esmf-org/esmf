\item [conservation] \label{glos:conservation}
      Conservative regridding requires that the area (or volume)
      integrated field on the source grid is equal to that on
      the destination grid, where the integration is over an
      identical area (volume).

\item [order] \label{glos:order}
      The order of the regridding refers to the order of accuracy
      (in a Taylor series sense) used to approximate a field during
      the regridding process.  First order is thus piecewise constant;
      second order is linear.

\item [monotone] \label{glos:monotone}
      A monotone regridding will not introduce new minima or
      maxima into a regridded field.
