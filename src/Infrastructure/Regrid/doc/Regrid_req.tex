%===============================================================================
% Requirements may be itemized under a main topic:
%===============================================================================
%===============================================================================
\req{General regridding requirements}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are general requirements for regridding operations and are in
addition to the applicable general ESMF requirements (see ESMF General
Requirements document).

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Creation}

Components must be able to create a regridding given two ESMF grids and 
initialize various time-independent regridding quantities.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} All codes will require this. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} This function will, in many cases, be computing
             regridding weights and initializing various
             communication information for performing regridding.
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Index space regridding}

A creation method must be supplied for regridding based only on logical 
indices of grid points and thus only on distributed grid information.  
Such a function is useful for nested grid and multi-grid applications where 
no physical grid information is required for creating the regridding.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:}  WRF, NSIPP, MIT. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Will need a general way to specify stencils
\end{reqlist}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Destruction}

Components must be able to destroy regriddings to free up memory.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} POP, GFDL, CICE, CAM desired, NSIPP, CCSM-CPL, NCEP-SSI, MIT. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} 
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Query}

Components must be able to query various properties of a regridding.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1 \\
{\bf Source:} CCSM-CPL, NCEP-SSI, MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Components should not need to access internal
             regridding fields, but it might be useful to access some
             aspects (eg names of grids) for error checking and verification.
             Exact query functions will be determined
             after design of structure is determined.
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Change}

Components should be able to change individual properties of a
regridding.  Examples might include adjusting regridding weights to 
renormalize or to adapt to dynamic area fractions (like ice fraction).

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 3. \\
{\bf Source:} CCSM-CPL, NCEP-SSI, MIT. \\
{\bf Status:} Rejected -- see notes. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} It was felt during the review that allowing users to change
             regridding properties would open the door for naive users to 
             destroy regridding properties like conservation.  For the example
             above (dynamic ice fraction), the desired functionality can
             be obtained through the merge function or by supplying very fast
             creation functions.
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Reading}

ESMF will provide a method for reading a regridding from a file. 

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} POP, CICE, CAM desired, NSIPP, CCSM-CPL, NCEP-SSI, MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Useful if creating regriddings is time-consuming to avoid
             start-up costs. Also permits off-line computation of regridding.
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Writing}

ESMF will provide a method for writing a regridding to a file in a well
documented and supported format. 

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} POP, CICE, CAM desired, NSIPP, CCSM-CPL, NCEP-SSI, MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Useful if creating regriddings is time-consuming - compute once
             and save for later re-use.  Also useful for any off-line
             use of same regridding info.
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Support for ESMF grids}

Regridding operations must be available for all supported ESMF grids.
Not all regridding operations are appropriate for
all grid types; restrictions will be noted in individual requirements.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} All codes require this. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} System test 
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Multiple fields}

Regridding of multiple fields (bundles of fields) with
a single call must be supported.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1  \\
{\bf Source:} CCSM-CPL, NCEP-GSM, NCEP-SSI, MIT, GFDL, NSIPP. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} This should be supplied for efficiency, but may not
             be required to achieve functionality.
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Interface requires only data arrays}

An interface requiring only data arrays shall be
provided.  Such an interface would not require the overhead
of a full field structure and is supplied for efficiency.
It will be the user's responsibility to ensure the arrays
are consistent with the regridding operation.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} POP, CICE, CAM desired, CCSM-CPL, NCEP-GSM, NCEP-SSI, MIT, WRF, GFDL, NSIPP \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Field info may still be used for creation of the
             regrid object.
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Consistency of field bundles}

The regridding function must check if the input field bundle and output field
bundle are consistent with each other, particularly in number of fields 
and grids on which the fields are placed.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2. \\
{\bf Source:} POP, CICE, CAM desired, NSIPP, CCSM-CPL, NCEP-SSI, NCEP-GSM, MIT. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} A rudimentary error check, but would probably rely on
             consistent naming convention for fields?
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Multiple methods per grid pair}

It shall be possible to create more than one regridding for a given grid
pair.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} POP, CICE, CAM required, CCSM-CPL, MIT, GFDL, NSIPP. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Both non-conservative and conservative methods will be needed
             between the same two grids.
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Consistency of coordinates}

Regridding will assume source and destination grids will be
specified in the same reference coordinate system.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by all. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Code inspection  \\
{\bf Notes:} No knowledge of the projection used or the physics of the 
             coordinate are required for performing a regridding.  For example,
             if a horizontal grid is in Cartesian coordinates, coordinates of
             points on the second grid must also be Cartesian with the same 
             origin and axes. Similarly, if the coordinates of one grid are in 
             spherical coordinates, the second grid must also use the same 
             spherical coordinates.  The restriction also applies to vertical 
             coordinates where the regridding will not be expected to know 
             how to transform between different coordinate choices 
             (eg pressure to isentropic).  Exceptions to this are permitted 
             if the user supplies the regridding routine (see later
             requirement on user-supplied regridding).
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Consistency of coordinates check}

The regridding function must check that the grids are in fact consistent
with each other.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by all. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Code inspection  \\
{\bf Notes:} This requirement implies some additional grid attributes for
             PhysGrid. 
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Interpolation adjoints}

Adjoints shall be provided for linear regridding methods, where linear
implies the regridding can be cast as a linear operator (eg matrix 
multiplication). This is generally possible for regriddings that are 
independent of the field being regridded (see following requirement).
Methods where adjoints are absolutely required have been so noted within 
their own respective descriptions.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} PSAS, NCEP-SSI, MIT (milestone).\\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Needed by PSAS, but not milestone
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Masked regridding}

It shall be possible to restrict the regridding to parts of a grid through 
the use of a mask.  Note that use of a mask is inappropriate for some methods 
(eg spectral transforms) and will not be supported for those methods.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} CCSM-CPL, WRF, NSIPP, NCEP-GSM, MIT. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} 
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Mask consistency}

If masks are supplied for both source and destination grids, a
method for checking consistency of those masks must be supplied.
Alternatively, a convention for resolving mask conflicts must
be determined and documented.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} WRF, NSIPP, NCEP-GSM, MIT. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} 
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Independence of field}

Whenever possible, regridding should be formulated to be
independent of the field being regridded.  This requirement exists to
aid the creation of an adjoint, to enable pre-computation of regridding
weights and to enable re-use of regridding information for multiple
fields.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by all. \\
{\bf Status:} Rejected (covered by other requirements). \\
{\bf Verification:} Code inspection  \\
{\bf Notes:} 
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Dependence of field}

For regridding schemes which might require field information,
the required field information can be passed as arguments.
Some higher-order regridding schemes require information on the
gradient or other moments of a field.  In such cases, this 
supplemental field information must be computed by the component 
and passed to the regridding function so that the regridding does 
not require detailed knowledge of operators or grid topology on every
supported grid or field.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} Required by all. \\
{\bf Status:} Rejected (covered by other requirements). \\
{\bf Verification:} Code inspection  \\
{\bf Notes:} This requirement could also be satisfied by a later requirement
             for user-supplied regridding routines.
\end{reqlist}

%===============================================================================
\req{Regridding algorithms}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains requirements on regridding algorithms themselves.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Conservation}

Regridding methods must be supplied which are
\htmlref{conservative}{glos:conservation}.  Where possible,
higher-order conservative methods should also be supplied.  This requirement
applies only to ESMF grids which have an area (2-d), volume (3-d) or
linear region (1-d) associated with them such that conservation is well
defined.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} POP,CICE,CAM required, NSIPP, CCSM-CPL, MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Methods exist for both first and second-order
             conservative schemes in 1-d and 2-d \cite{Jones1999}.
             Conservative methods for 3-d field (eg Monte Carlo
             or 3-d extensions to the above methods) are more difficult
             and may have a lower priority.
             High-order conservative schemes are more expensive and
             no schemes higher than second-order have been implemented.
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Verification of conservation}

A method for verifying conservation must be supplied.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2. \\
{\bf Source:} CCSM-CPL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} For error checking and testing.
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Monotonicity}

\htmlref{Monotone}{glos:monotone} regridding methods must be supplied.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 3. \\
{\bf Source:} CAM-FV, CAM-EUL, MIT. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Biogeochemical models may need this.  First-order
             conservative schemes are generally monotone by
             construction, so this could be satisfied by the
             conservation requirement for gridded data.
             1-d monotone schemes are required for some hybrid
             and Lagrangian vertical coordinate schemes
             (eg CAM-FV, HYPOP), but are sufficiently linked
             to details of dynamics that they may need to
             remain in ``user space'' and not be covered by
             the framework.
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Higher-order schemes}

Regridding methods which are higher than first \htmlref{order}{glos:order}
must be supplied.  This is required for preventing
``patchwork'' patterns when regridding from coarse to fine
grids and for preventing discontinuities in gradients of
regridded fields.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:}  POP, CICE, CAM required, CCSM-CPL, NCEP-GSM, NCEP-SSI, MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 2. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} This will require either internal approximations to
             gradients (eg bilinear, bicubic, trilinear) or will require the
             user to pass gradient information (eg second-order conservative
             methods).  See requirements on field dependence.  Also, this
             requirement can be in conflict with monotonicity requirements.
             Options to specify what happens to higher-order at
             boundaries are needed.
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Vector fields in physical space}

Regridding methods must be available for regridding a horizontal
vector field with components aligned with physical directions
(eg zonal-meridional or x-y), where the physical direction may be
inferred by the grid type or specified by user.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:}  POP, CICE, CAM required, NSIPP, CCSM-CPL, NCEP-SSI, MIT. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} In spherical coordinates, meridional velocity components
             may be improperly handled except in simple latitude-longitude
             grid combinations.
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Vector fields in logical space}

Regridding methods must be available for regridding a horizontal
vector field with components aligned along grid logical directions.
Logical directions here refer to directions parallel and perpendicular
to cell sides.  Such a method would correctly handle flow through 
coordinate singularities such as the poles in spherical coordinates.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:}  POP, CICE (CCSM) desired, NSIPP, CCSM-CPL (desired), MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} 
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Regridding based on index space}

Methods must be available for regridding based only on logical indices of 
grid points and thus only on distributed grid information.  
Such a function is useful for nested grid and multi-grid applications where 
no physical grid information is required for creating the regridding.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:}  WRF required, NSIPP, MIT. \\
{\bf Status:} Rejected (moved this requirement to creation requirement). \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Will need a general way to specify stencils
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Index space changes}

A method must be supplied for rapidly changing the
regridding in cases where indices of one grid shift in relation 
to the other grid (eg as a nested grid moves in relation to its 
parent).  The regridding in this case would be utilizing the
same stencil and weights; only the addresses of the grid points
would shift.  Because of the simple nature of this operation,
this requirement provides an efficient short-cut, avoiding
re-creating a regridding using calls to create or destroy methods.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:}  WRF required. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} A requirement for this exists for the distributed grid, so
             Regrid would utilize the distributed grid functionality to 
             accomplish this.
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Fourier transforms}

Methods shall be supplied for regridding between physical space and
Fourier space.  The adjoints shall also be supplied.  Ordering in
Fourier space will be defined by the distributed grid.  This requirement 
applies only to grids consistent with the Fourier transform (eg lat/lon grids,
reduced grids, spectral elements, etc.).

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:}  NCEP-GSM, NCEP-SSI (milestone), GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Return types for Fourier modes}

Results of Fourier transforms can be returned as either
complex numbers or as real numbers in a specified order.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:}  NCEP-GSM, NCEP-SSI, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. 
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Parallel implementations}

Distributed FFT algorithms will be supported for a limited
number of specific configurations.  Note that a transpose
algorithm (in which a local serial transform is combined
with data transposes to redistribute data) will always
be supported for the general case.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:}  \\
{\bf Status:} Rejected (see notes). \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} It was felt that the real requirement was for
             efficient parallel transforms and specifying
             implementations was a design detail.  Also, alternative
             implementations can be covered under the user-defined
             requirements.
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Legendre transforms}

Methods shall be supplied for regridding between spectral space and
Fourier space.  The adjoints shall also be supplied.  This requirement
applies only to grids consistent with the Legendre transform (the
data must be located at appropriate quadrature points).
Both scalar and vector fields must be supported.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:}  NCEP-GSM, NCEP-SSI (milestone), NSIPP. \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. 
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Data types for Fourier modes}

Legendre transforms must support Fourier modes stored as either
complex numbers or as real numbers in a specified order.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:}  NCEP-GSM, NCEP-SSI. \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:}  Companion to the Fourier requirement above.
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Parallel implementations}

Distributed Legendre algorithms will be supported for a limited
number of specific configurations.  Note that a transpose
algorithm (in which a local serial transform is combined
with data transposes to redistribute data) will always
be supported for the general case.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:}  \\
{\bf Status:} Rejected (see notes). \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Similar to the Fourier requirement,
             it was felt that the real requirement was for
             efficient parallel transforms and specifying
             implementations was a design detail.  Also, alternative
             implementations can be covered under the user-defined
             requirements.
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Other functional transforms}

Methods shall be supplied for regridding using user-supplied matrices,
particularly between functional space and physical space.
The adjoints shall also be supplied.  The grids again must be consistent
with the functional transform being applied.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:}  NCEP-SSI (milestone), NSIPP, MIT. \\
{\bf Status:} Redundant (falls under extensibility requirement below). \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. 
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Interpolating from gridded data to ungridded data}

All methods shall work for regridding FROM gridded data TO ungridded
data, except that no conservation properties are required.
Adjoints shall be supplied for interpolation TO ungridded data.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:}  NCEP-SSI (milestone), PSAS (not milestone), NSIPP, MIT.  \\
{\bf Status:} Redundant - ungridded is a supported ESMF ``grid'' and is therefore
              covered under earlier requirements. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} 
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Interpolating from ungridded data to gridded data}

Methods for regridding FROM ungridded data TO gridded data may be
supplied (eg nearest-neighbor distance-weighted schemes).

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 3. \\
{\bf Source:} MIT.  \\
{\bf Status:} Redundant (see notes). \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Since ungridded data are represented by ESMF grids, they are
             technically covered by all earlier requirements.  However, many
             of the above requirements are not applicable to such cases or may
             be applicable only if associated with a ``background grid.''
\end{reqlist}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Extensibility}

It shall be possible for users to supply their own regridding
routines.  This is especially useful for regriddings that are
strongly dependent on model fields.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2. \\
{\bf Source:}  CAM-FV, NSIPP, CCSM-CPL, MIT. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved 1. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. 
\end{reqlist}

%===============================================================================
\req{Other utilities}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are utilities related to regridding which should be made
public.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\sreq{Exchange grid}

A method for constructing a new grid formed by the intersecting
cells of two grids shall be available.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:}  \\
{\bf Source:}  NSIPP, MIT, GFDL. \\
{\bf Status:} Moved to PhysGrid requirements. \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. 
\end{reqlist}
