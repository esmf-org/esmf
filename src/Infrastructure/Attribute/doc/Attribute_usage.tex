This section describes the use of the Attribute class.  There are eight 
examples that follow, which outline the use of Attributes at three increasing 
levels of difficulty.  The first example covers basic Attribute manipulations 
on the gridded Component.  The second example covers the Attribute package 
capabilities, including Attribute package nesting and Attribute hierarchy 
linking.  The third example covers Attribute management in a distributed 
environment and the I/O utilities.  These examples will be best understood if 
followed in an ascending order from basic to advanced.  The fourth example 
shows how to use the CIM Attribute packages.  The last four examples cover 
setting of Attribute packages and custom Attributes from an XML file.
