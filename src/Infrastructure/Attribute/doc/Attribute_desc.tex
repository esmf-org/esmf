The ESMF Attribute class is used to store metadata describing
other objects in the framework.  
Attributes are (name, value) pairs, where
the name is a character string and the value can be either a single
value or list of {\tt int}/{\tt I*4}, {\tt double}/{\tt R*8},
logical ({\tt ESMF\_Logical}), or {\tt char *}/{\tt character} values.
Mixed types are not allowed in a single Attribute, and all Attribute
names must be unique within a single object.    Attributes are set
by name, and can be retrieved either directly by name or by querying
for a count of Attributes and retrieving names and values
by index number.


Currently Attributes can be defined for the following ESMF objects:

\begin{itemize}
\item FieldBundle
\item Field
\item State
\end{itemize}
