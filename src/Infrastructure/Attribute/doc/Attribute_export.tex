\label{sec:AttributeExports}

The {\tt ESMF\_AttributeWrite()} interface is used to write the contents of an Attribute package to a file.  This routine can be called on any ESMF object that is capable of holding Attribute packages.  It can also write out all Attributes in Attribute packages with the same specifiers throughout an entire ESMF object hierarchy. 

There are three primary ways of exporting Attributes:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Tab-delimited ASCII
   \item Simple XML 
   \item CIM XML
\end{enumerate}

The flag that is used in the {\tt ESMF\_AttributeWrite()} interface to determine which format for writing the Attribute packages is called the {\tt ESMF\_AttWriteFlag}.  The resulting file will be placed in the execution directory after it is written and closed.

\subsubsection{Tab-delimited ASCII}

When {\tt ESMF\_AttWriteFlag} is set to {\tt ESMF\_ATTWRITE\_TAB} (the default), a tab-delimites ascii file containing name-value pairs of attributes in the packages will be written.  The file will be named for the name of the ESMF object from which {\tt ESMF\_AttributeWrite()} is called. The suffix will be .stdout.


\subsubsection{Simple XML}

When {\tt ESMF\_AttWriteFlag} is set to {\tt ESMF\_ATTWRITE\_XML}, an XML file containing name-value pairs of attributes in the packages will be written.  The file will be named for the name of the ESMF object from which {\tt ESMF\_AttributeWrite()} is called. The suffix will be .xml.

\subsubsection{CIM XML}

When the ESMF object from which {\tt ESMF\_AttributeWrite()} is called is a Component, and the Attribute package convention="CIM 1.0", and the purpose="Model Component Simulation Description", and {\tt ESMF\_AttWriteFlag} is set to {\tt ESMF\_ATTWRITE\_XML}, an XML file conforming to the CIM standard will be written.  The file will contain Attributes from the entire Component tree and their contained Fields.  The file will be named for the name of the ESMF Component object from which {\tt ESMF\_AttributeWrite()} is called, and the suffix will be .xml.
