\subsubsection{Attributes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Case insensitive Attribute names, conventions, purposes, and values will be enabled in a future release.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Attribute packages}

\begin{itemize}
\item A future capability may be to automatically create default object Attribute packages upon ESMF object creation.
\item The implemention of Grids is still in flux within the CIM.  This will affect the final appearance of the Gridspec package in both ESMF and ESG. It is anticipated that an additional CIM Grid Attribute Package will be created.
\item A CIM Scientific Property Attribute Package will be added. For CMIP5, hundreds of Scientific Properties have been identified. All of these will be added to ESMF. 
\item The Attribute packages ISO Responsible Party, ISO Citation, and CIM Platform can only be created automatically within a CIM Main component Attribute package.  In a future release, it will be possible to create these within other CIM Attribute packages as required, or as separate, standalone packages.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Attribute hierarchies}

\begin{itemize}
\item The option of "deep" copies of an Attribute hierarchy will be added.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Attribute import and export}
\begin{itemize}
\item The CIM XML output in this release validates against the official CIM v1.5 release.  CIM development is continuing, with further releases expected.  ESMF, in its future releases, will conform to these future CIM releases.
\item The CIM XML output format, as described above, is currently ingestable into ESG. However, ESG, like CIM, is in flux with active development.  When ESG officially releases, future releases of ESMF will be compatible with it.  The goal is for all three of ESMF, ESG, and CIM to be compatible with each other.
\item Only the CIM XML format is targeted for ingestion by ESG, not ESMF XML nor tab-delimited.
\item CIM Attribute packages can only be output (to CIM XML); they may be inputtable (via XML) in a future release.
\item The ESMF grid Attribute package XML output file only contains the nested GridSpec Attributes; Attributes RegDecompX and RegDecompY will be added in a future release. 
\end{itemize}
