%\section{Synopsis}

The Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) Communications/Memory/Kernel (CMK)
library provides utilities for isolating system-dependent functions to ease
platform portability.  It provides services to represent a particular machine's
characteristics and to organize these into processor lists and layouts to
allow for optimal allocation of processors to an ESMF component. Also provided
is a unified interface for system-dependent communication services such as
MPI or pthreads.  The CMK library is designed to meet the requirements as
specified in the ESMF Communications and Memory Kernels Requirements document
\cite {commmem_req}.
