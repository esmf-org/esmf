\subsubsection{ESMF\_DePinFlag}

\label{opt:depinflag}
{\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}
Specifies which VM resource DEs are pinned to - i.e. PETs or VASs.

Valid values are:
\begin{description}
   \item [ESMF\_DE\_PIN\_PET] 
         Pin DEs against PETs. This means that even if a group of PETs in the 
         VM are sharing a common virtual address space (VAS), DEs cannot
         be shared between PETs, but must be serviced by the specific PET they
         are pinned to.
   \item [ESMF\_DE\_PIN\_VAS]
         Pin DEs against VASs. DEs may be serviced by any PET that is 
         executing within the virtual address space (VAS) the DE is pinned to.
\end{description}
