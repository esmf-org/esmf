The time class is used to perform fundamental operations related to time 
intervals.  A time consists of a number of days and a time of day, which
is contained in a separate time of day class.  Intervals less than a day 
may be represented by integer seconds, integer seconds plus milliseconds, 
or float seconds.  Currently only integer seconds are implemented.

Basic operations supported by the time class include setting and getting
time attributes, copying times, and incrementing and decrementing times.
