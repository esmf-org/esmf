#

#
# This file contains the regrid/redist problem descriptor strings for the testing harness.
# Requirements:
# This configuration file follows the Config class syntax. The problem descriptor strings # are stored as 
# strings in a table and must follow the statement "problem_descriptor_string::" and be terminated by double 
# colons "::". The # sign signifies everything that follows it is a comment, and should be ignored by the 
# parser. The descriptors must be enclosed by quotation marks " or '.
# See documentation for further details of the descriptor syntax.
#
# Syntax Summary
#       Process specification: --> (redist), =*=> (remap, *=B, C, P, S, N, ...)
#       Chunks of memory are enclosed by [ ], and delineated by ;
#       Grid specification: G (tensor grid), U (unstructured)
#       Distribution specification: B (block), C (block cyclic), A (arbitrary)
#
# Specification files
# Following the problem descriptor string are filename(s) with the complete problem specification.
#       -d DeLayout/distgrid specification
#       -g Grid Specification
# Multiple filenames can be used to specify the respective parameter space.       
#
# ex.
#       '[B1G1;B2G2] =B=> [B1G1;B2G2]' -d distgrid.rc otherdistgrid.rc -g igrid.rc
# specifies that a remapping test is to be conducted where the range of distributions 
# is specified by two files and the range of grid types is specified by a single file.
