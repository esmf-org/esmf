The Calendar class has one parameter which defines the number of months
in a year.  For different planetary bodies, this can be edited and
recompiled.

        \#define MONTHSPERYEAR 12

If required, a future enhancement possibility would be to pass this as an
argument to the CalendarInit() method.  The advantage would be no source
code change required, but the disadvantage would be that it requires
dynamic memory allocation, which the requirements document disallows.
