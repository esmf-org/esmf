The {\tt Clock} class contains {\tt Time} instants and a {\tt TimeInterval}
to track and time step model time.  For tracking, {\tt Time} instants are
instantiated for the current time, stop time, start time, reference time,
and previous time.  For time stepping, a single {\tt TimeInterval} is
instantiated.  There is also an integer counter for keeping track of the
number of timesteps, and an array of associated alarms.  Methods are
defined for advancing the clock (perform a time step), checking if the
stop time is reached, synchronizing with a real-time clock, and getting
values of the class attributes defined above. After performing the time
step, the advance method will iterate over the alarm list and return a
list of any active alarms.
