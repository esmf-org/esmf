{\tt Time} inherits from the base class {\tt BaseTime}.  As such, it gains
the core representation of time as well as its associated methods.
{\tt Time} further specializes {\tt BaseTime} by adding shortcut methods
to set and get a {\tt Time} in a natural way with appropriate unit
combinations, as per the requirements.  A {\tt Time} is calendar-dependent,
since its largest units of time are months and years.  {\tt Time} also
defines special methods for getting the day of the year, day of the week,
middle of the month, and synchronizing with a real-time clock.  {\tt Time}
adds its associated {\tt Calendar} and local Timezone attributes to
{\tt BaseTime}.
