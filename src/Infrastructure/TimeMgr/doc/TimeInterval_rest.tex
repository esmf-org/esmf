\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Limits on time span.} The limits on the time span that can be
represented are based on the 64-bit integer types used.  For
seconds, a signed 64-bit integer will have a range of +/- $2^{63}$-1, or
+/- 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.  This corresponds to a range of
+/- ($2^{63}$-1)/(86400 * 365.25) or +/- 292,271,023,045 years.

For fractional seconds, a signed 64-bit integer will handle a resolution of
+/- $2^{31}$-1, or +/- 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 parts of a second.
