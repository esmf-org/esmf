The Calendar class encapsulates the definition of all required calendar types.
For each calendar type, it contains the number of months per year, the
number of days in each month, the number of seconds in a day, the number of
days per year, and the number of fractional days per year.  This flexible
definition allows future calendars to be defined for any planetary body, not
just Earth. 

The Calendar class defines two methods for converting in both
directions between the core Time class representation and a calendar date.
Calculations of time intervals (deltas) between time instants is done by the
base class Time in the core units of seconds and fractional seconds.  Thus,
a calendar is only needed for converting core time to calendar time and vice
versa.
