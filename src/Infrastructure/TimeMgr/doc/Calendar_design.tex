The {\tt Calendar} class encapsulates the definition of all required
calendar types. For each calendar type, it contains the number of months
per year, the number of days in each month, the number of seconds in a day,
the number of days per year, and the number of fractional days per year.
This flexible definition allows future calendars to be defined for any
planetary body, not just Earth.

The {\tt Calendar} class defines two methods for converting in both
directions between the core {\tt BaseTime} class representation and a
calendar date.  Calculations of time intervals (deltas) between
timeiinstants is done by the base class {\tt BaseTime} in the core units
of seconds and fractional seconds.  Thus,  a calendar is only needed for
converting core time to calendar time and vice versa.
