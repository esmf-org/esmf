The {\tt ESMF\_ArrayBundle} class allows a set of Arrays to be bundled into a
single object. The Arrays in an ArrayBundle may be of different type, kind,
rank and distribution. Besides ease of use resulting from bundling, the
ArrayBundle class offers the opportunity for performance optimization when
operating on a bundle of Arrays as a single entity.  Communication methods are 
especially good candidates for performance optimization. Best optimization
results are expected for ArrayBundles that contain Arrays that share a common
distribution, i.e. DistGrid, and are of same type, kind and rank.

ArrayBundles are one of the data objects that can be added to States,
which are used for providing to or receiving data from other Components.
