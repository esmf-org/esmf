      ESMF Configuration Management is based on NASA DAO's 
      Inpak 90 package, a Fortran 90 collection of routines/functions
      for accessing {\em Resource Files} in ASCII format.The package 
      is optimized for minimizing formatted I/O, performing all of its 
      string operations in memory using Fortran intrinsic functions.\\

      Module ${\tt ESMF\_ConfigMod}$ is implemented in Fortran.
