% <Describe strategy for overall class design.>

The FieldBundle class depends on the underlying Field class for most of its
communication and querying functions.  The information which
must be maintained by the FieldBundle class is a list of constituent
Fields, and whether there is a packed Array at the FieldBundle level.

Memory layout information is encapsulated in an DataMap object which
is attached to the FieldBundle.  It can be accessed by querying the FieldBundle.

The FieldBundle class can aggregate multiple Fields which share a
common or compatible Grid object.  In addition to the basic methods for
setting, retrieving, and querying the constituent Fields, it provides
methods for configuring and querying memory layouts for the Array
and some limited collective operations on all Fields in a FieldBundle.
