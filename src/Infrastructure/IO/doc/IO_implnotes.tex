\subsection{Design and Implementation Notes}

For data I/O, the ESMF I/O capability relies on the
\htmladdnormallink{PIO}{https://github.com/NCAR/ParallelIO} and
\htmladdnormallink{NetCDF}{http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf}
libraries, and optionally the
\htmladdnormallink{PNetCDF}{http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/parallel-netcdf} 
library.  For Info attribute I/O, the ESMF I/O capability uses the
\htmladdnormallink{JSON for Modern C++}{https://github.com/nlohmann/json}
library to perform reading of JSON files. PIO and JSON for Modern C++
are included with the ESMF distribution; the other libraries must be
installed on the machine of interest.
