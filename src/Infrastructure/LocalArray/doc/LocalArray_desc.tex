The {\tt ESMF\_LocalArray} class provides a language independent 
representation of data in array format. One of the major functions 
of the LocalArray class is to bridge the Fortran/C/C++ language 
difference that exists with respect to array representation. All 
ESMF Field and Array data is internally stored in ESMF LocalArray 
objects allowing transparent access from Fortran and C/C++.

In the ESMF Fortran API the LocalArray becomes visible in those cases 
where a local PET may be associated with multiple pieces of an Array, 
e.g. if there are multiple DEs associated with a single PET. The Fortran 
language standard does not provide an array of arrays construct, however 
arrays of derived types holding arrays are possible. ESMF calls use 
arguments that are of type {\tt ESMF\_LocalArray} with {\tt dimension} 
attributes where necessary.
