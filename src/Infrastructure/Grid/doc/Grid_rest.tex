%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Grids with factorized coordinates can only be redisted when they are 2D.}  Using the ESMF_GridCreate() interface that allows the user to create a copy of an existing Grid with a new distribution will give incorrect results when used on a Grid with 3 or more dimensions and whose coordinate arrays are less than the full dimension of the Grid (i.e. it contains factorized coordinates).

\item {\bf 7D limit.}  Only grids up to 7D will be supported.

\item {\bf Future adaptation.}  Currently Grids
are created and then remain unchanged. In the future, it would
be useful to provide support for the various forms of grid
adaptation. This would allow the grids to dynamically change
their resolution to more closely match what is needed at a particular
time and position during a computation for front tracking or adaptive meshes.


\item {\bf Future Grid generation.} This class for now only contains
the basic functionality for operating on the grid. In the future
methods will be added to enable the automatic generation of various types of
grids.
