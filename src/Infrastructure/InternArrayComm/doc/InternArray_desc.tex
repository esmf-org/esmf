%\subsection{Description}

An ESMF Array, as one might expect, represents a multidimensional array.
It can be real, integer, or logical, and can possess up to seven 
dimensions.  The array can be strided.  The first dimension specified 
is always the one which varies fastest in linearized memory. 

Arrays can be created, destroyed, copied, and indexed.  Communication
methods, such as redistribution, are also defined.  For information on 
Array halo domains and operations, see Section \ref{sec:halo}.
