%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Redistribution only fills computational domains.}  Currently,
redistributed values are not automatically applied to halo or ghost
domains.  Users must manually call Halo after redistribution in order
to do so.  This also means that InternGrid periodicity will not affect
results without manual Halo calls.

\item {\bf Masks are not implemented.}  Redist methods should apply
any Masks attached to the data objects, but they currently do not.  Redist
interfaces should also include Masks as arguments.

\end{enumerate}
